To examine whether an active <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulatory process</SCOPE> occurs , we created a reporter construct containing as an enhancer four copies of the NF-AT site and one copy of the octamer site ( 4X NF-AT-Oct ) .

<SCOPE>Addition of the -176 to -96 sequence to the 4X NF-AT-Oct construct did <NEG>not</NEG> impart the ability to be affected by anergy</SCOPE> , but addition of the -236 to -96 sequence did , demonstrating that anergy is an active inhibitory process and that more than the presence of the -150 AP-1 binding site ( -152 to -147 ) is required to mediate the effect .

Because <SCOPE>the -180 site is <NEG>not</NEG> required for trans-activation</SCOPE> , it was possible to confirm by mutation in the normal mouse IL-2 enhancer that this site is absolutely essential for anergy induction .

The simplest model to explain these results is that anergy is mediated by a complex of multiple transcription factors that exert a cis-acting dominant <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulatory effect</SCOPE> on the trans-activation of the IL-2 gene .

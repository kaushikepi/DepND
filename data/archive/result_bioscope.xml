By using PD98059 , we demonstrated that <SCOPE>the Raf1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway did <NEG>not</NEG> affect the DNA binding of NF-kappa B but , rather , acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B</SCOPE> .

In contrast , another inducible gene expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( a CC chemokine ) and the activation of the transcriptional factor ( FcRFgamma ) bound to the gamma response region were similarly or less abundantly induced by IFNgamma treatment in PMA- or RA-differentiated U937 cells , indicating that <SCOPE>increased IP-10 mRNA induction was <NEG>not</NEG> due to the augmented ability of the cells to respond to the presence of IFNgamma</SCOPE> .

Finally , immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts showed <SCOPE>decreased or <NEG>absent</NEG> p65 protein levels</SCOPE> .

The data obtained show that the three GCH molecules exert an immunosuppression on cytokine production by T lymphocytes and a strong decrease in the nuclear translocation of NF-kB in Jurkat cells ; moreover , ( a ) <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> all the cytokines investigated were affected , and not with the same intensity , by the three GCH</SCOPE> and ( b ) DXM inhibited the binding activity of NF-kB less than that of DFC and PDN .

By using Jurkat and primary human T lymphocytes , we demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of two second messengers of the TCR-initiated signal transduction , protein kinase C ( PKC ) and calcineurin , results in the synergistic activation of the IkappaBalpha kinase ( IKK ) complex but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> of another putative IkappaBalpha kinase , p90 ( rsk )</SCOPE> .

We also demonstrate that <SCOPE>the IKK complex , but <NEG>not</NEG> p90 ( rsk ) , is responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha mediated by the co-activation of PKC and calcineurin</SCOPE> .

Overexpression of dominant <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> forms of IKKalpha and -beta</SCOPE> demonstrates that only IKKbeta is the target for PKC and calcineurin .

In our previous study , we demonstrated a major positive regulatory role for GATA-1 and a <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulatory role for GATA-2 in MBP gene transcription</SCOPE> .

To determine the functionality of both the C/EBP- and GATA- binding sites , we analyzed whether C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 can stimulate the MBP promoter in the C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> Jurkat T-cell line</SCOPE> .

Our results provide the first evidence that both GATA-1 and C/EBPbeta synergistically transactivate the promoter of an eosinophil-specific granule protein gene and that FOG may act as a <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> cofactor for the eosinophil lineage</SCOPE> , unlike its positively regulatory function for the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages .

The requirement for TNF is further confirmed by the observation that the inability of the intermediate CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( - ) CD3 ( - ) thymocytes to replicate the virus is associated with a defect in TNF production during their interaction with TEC and correlates <SCOPE>with the <NEG>absence</NEG> of nuclear NF-kappaB activity in these freshly isolated thymocytes</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>The other major subpopulation expressing the CD4 receptor , namely , the double-positive ( DP ) CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) CD3 ( +/- ) thymocytes , despite the entry of the virus , do <NEG>not</NEG> produce a significant level of virus , presumably because they are unresponsive to TNF and IL-7</SCOPE> .

Promoter assays revealed CD28-dependent effects <SCOPE>on both NF-kappaB and AP-1 , but <NEG>not</NEG> on NF-AT or the intact IL-2</SCOPE> promoter .

We conclude that CD28 costimulation can cause substantial T cell proliferation <SCOPE>in the <NEG>absence</NEG> of IL-2 , which is driven by a soluble factor independent of NF-AT</SCOPE> transactivation .

However , <SCOPE>the mechanism by which IFNs mediate this inhibition has <NEG>not</NEG> been defined</SCOPE> .

Pretreatment of monocytes with IFN-beta or IFN-gamma , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> IL-1 , IL-2 , macrophage colony-stimulating factor , granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor , IL-6 , or transforming growth</SCOPE> factor beta suppressed activation of STAT6 by IL-4 .

Southwestern and gel renaturation experiments with the use of purified protein fractions revealed that TCF-1 alpha activity is derived from a family of 57- to 53-kD proteins that are abundantly expressed in mature and immature T-cell lines ( Jurkat , CCRF-CEM ) and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in mature B cells ( JY , Namalwa ) or nonlymphoid ( HeLa )</SCOPE> cell lines .

The TCF-1 alpha binding site was also required for TCR alpha enhancer activity in transcriptionally active extracts from Jurkat but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> HeLa cells</SCOPE> , confirming that TCF-1 alpha is a T-cell-specific transcription factor .

Each binding site contributes to the overall activity of the enhancer , however <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> single element</SCOPE> seems absolutely required for activity .

However , despite its ability to activate transcription of a transfected reporter gene , <SCOPE>the factor is apparently <NEG>unable</NEG> to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non-lymphoid cells</SCOPE> : In previous experiments by others , the characteristic in vivo footprint of this factor , designated NF-muE3 , was detected in B cells but not in non-B cells .

From this and other findings the picture emerges that there are at least three categories of factors which mediate cell-type-specific transcription in B lymphocytes : ( a ) cell-specific factors such as Oct-2A and Oct-2B that <SCOPE>are <NEG>not</NEG> expressed in most other cell types</SCOPE> : ( b ) ubiquitous factors such as NF-kappa B that are constitutively active in B cells but are sequestered in an inactive form in other cells ; ( c ) ubiquitously active factors , exemplified by the one binding to the E3 sequence motif .

This factor is present in an active form in a variety of cell types but <SCOPE>is apparently <NEG>unable</NEG> to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non-B cells , perhaps due to a non-permissive chromatin structure of the Ig heavy chain locus</SCOPE> .

Treatment of HL-60 cells with both TPA and cycloheximide had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect</SCOPE> on the rates of c-jun transcription .

Interestingly , alteration of either the microB or E3 site in a 70-base-pair fragment of the IgH enhancer that <SCOPE><NEG>lacks</NEG> the binding site for OCTA</SCOPE> abolished enhancer activity in lymphoid cells completely .

Although <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide</SCOPE> takes place even when protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide , the phorbol myristate acetate effect is blocked to some extent only by cycloheximide .

Therefore , two different <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulatory pathways</SCOPE> are involved in c-myc regulation : one which is independent and one which depends on de novo protein synthesis .

We have investigated the induction of these genes by macrophage-CSF ( M-CSF ) in human monocytes that <SCOPE>do <NEG>not</NEG> proliferate in response to M-CSF but require the factor for optimal cell differentiation</SCOPE> .

The c-jun gene expression was very transient and <SCOPE>was <NEG>not</NEG> detectable by 60 min after M-CSF addition</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did <NEG>not</NEG> block the induction of any of these genes , and in fact , super-induced the expression of c-jun and hck</SCOPE> .

Our finding that <SCOPE>induction of NF-kappa B by tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 is <NEG>not</NEG> sufficient to induce HIV enhancer-dependent transcription in cloned T cells</SCOPE> contrasts with results obtained in most lymphoblastoid T-cell lines and indicates that normal T lymphocytes differ from tumoral T cells in terms of requirements for HIV LTR activation .

Because insertion mutations in phoP are polar on phoQ , we constructed strains that expressed the PhoQ protein <SCOPE>in the <NEG>absence</NEG> of PhoP</SCOPE> to test whether resistance to defensin requires only the phoQ gene product .

Synergistic induction of the IL-6 gene by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha , in monocytic cells , involved cooperation between the IRF-1 and NF kappa B p65 homodimers with concomitant removal of the <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> effect of the retinoblastoma control element present in the IL-6 promoter</SCOPE> .

We therefore reexamined this issue by using two different experimental approaches that allowed LMP1- induced effects to be monitored immediately <SCOPE>following expression of the viral protein and in the <NEG>absence</NEG> of selective pressures</SCOPE> ; activation of the NF-kappa B transcription factor and upregulation of the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 were used as early indices of LMP1 function .

A predominance of p50 NF-kappa B moieties and possibly p50 homodimers or closely related species , <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> the p50-p56 heterodimer of NF-kappa B that is the predominant NF-kappa B species in most T lymphocytic and monocytic cells</SCOPE> , is demonstrated in the nuclei of U1 cells .

Northern blot analysis showed that <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> of these agents reduced LPS-stimulated TF mRNA accumulation</SCOPE> , thereby suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism for the effect .

Furthermore , <SCOPE>these conditions did <NEG>not</NEG> result in an accumulation of the less mature forms of TF</SCOPE> .

The effect of antioxidants on tumor necrosis factor appeared to be species specific , with <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor in murine cells</SCOPE> , but with inhibition in human monocytes .

Biochemical studies demonstrate that OBF-1 has no intrinsic DNA-binding activity and recognizes the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> those of Oct-4 and Oct-6</SCOPE> .

The OBF-1 mRNA is expressed in a highly cell-specific manner , being most abundant in B cells and <SCOPE>essentially <NEG>absent</NEG> in most of the other cells or tissues tested</SCOPE> .

However , <SCOPE>the events leading from the activated receptor to cell lysis are <NEG>not</NEG> understood</SCOPE> .

Furthermore , we show that retinoic acid can also induce apoptosis in these cells through the retinoic acid receptor , whose repressive functions but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> target site specificity</SCOPE> , are similar to those of the glucocorticoid receptor .

Therefore , the primary effect of the receptor in glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis correlates with transcriptional repression <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> activation</SCOPE> and could be mediated by interference with other transcription factors required for cell survival .

These latter effects were due <SCOPE>to increases in the nuclear localization of GR , <NEG>not</NEG> to reduced amounts of the other transcription</SCOPE> factors .

These results suggest that CaM-K II may exert <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> influences</SCOPE> on cytokine gene transcription in human T cells , and provide preliminary evidence for negative cross-talk with the calcineurin- and PKC- dependent signaling systems .

Negative , positive , and <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effects of Nef</SCOPE> have also been reported on viral replication in cells .

<SCOPE><NEG>Not</NEG> only do these positional effects of Nef reconcile diverse phenotypes of Nef and suggest a role for its N-terminal myristylation</SCOPE> , but they also explain effects of Nef in HIV infection and progression to AIDS .

Human RXR alpha was significantly expressed in U937 and THP-1 cells , weakly <SCOPE>expressed in H9 cells and <NEG>not</NEG> detectable in CEM cells</SCOPE> .

After stimulation by PMA , RXR alpha expression increased in H9 and U937 cells but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in CEM cells</SCOPE> .

We have previously described a mutant B lymphoblastoid cell line , Clone-13 , that expresses HLA-DQ <SCOPE>in the <NEG>absence</NEG> of HLA-DR and -DP</SCOPE> .

Insertion of oligonucleotides spanning the DQB <SCOPE>X-box ( but <NEG>not</NEG> the DQB-W region or the DQB Y-box ) upstream of -141 in a DRA reporter plasmid</SCOPE> rescued expression to nearly wild-type levels .

<SCOPE><NEG>None</NEG> of the hybrid reporter constructs</SCOPE> were defective when transfected into the wild-type , HLA-DR/-DQ positive parental cell line , Jijoye .

This element has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> activity</SCOPE> in T cells of the Jurkat line .

The NFATd element , which binds the transcription factor NFAT-1 and is very active in T cells , is only weakly active <SCOPE>in one B clone and <NEG>not</NEG> at all in another</SCOPE> .

Removal of the carboxy terminus enables ERP to interact with a variety of ets-binding sites including the E74 site , the IgH enhancer pi site , and the lck promoter ets site , suggesting a carboxy-terminal <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulatory domain</SCOPE> .

HIV-1 expression was activated from J delta K cells <SCOPE>by treatment with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , sodium butyrate ( NaB ) , or hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) , but <NEG>not</NEG> tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , confirming the role of NF-kappa B in mediating TNF-alpha induction of HIV transcription</SCOPE> .

This resulted in only a partial inhibition of TNF- or PMA- induced HIV replication in U1 cells , and <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> detectable effect on HIV replication in chronically infected U937 cells</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>These parameters were <NEG>not</NEG> modified by Nef expression in Jurkat cells , whereas stimulation with the same stimuli resulted in partial inhibition of LTR activation in Nef+ Jurkat cells</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>This inhibition was <NEG>not</NEG> mediated through Nef phosphorylation on Thr-15 or GTP-binding activity because mutations in critical sites did not alter this inhibition</SCOPE> .
This inhibition was not mediated through Nef phosphorylation on Thr-15 or GTP-binding activity because <SCOPE>mutations in critical sites did <NEG>not</NEG> alter this inhibition</SCOPE> .

Analysis of truncated LTRs confirmed that <SCOPE>inhibition of LTR activation was <NEG>not</NEG> mediated through NF-kappa B-binding activity but through the region containing the negative responding elements ( NREs )</SCOPE> .
Analysis of truncated LTRs confirmed that inhibition of LTR activation was not mediated through NF-kappa B-binding activity but through the region containing the <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> responding elements ( NREs )</SCOPE> .

These results suggest that Nef downmodulates LTR activation <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> significantly inhibiting the capacity of T cells to respond to immunological activations</SCOPE> .

The second abnormality in kappa B-binding activity in T cells from these patients is that <SCOPE>RelA , a member of the Rel homology family which is part of the normal NF-kappa B complex , was <NEG>not</NEG> induced in the nucleus following activation</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>Western blotting analysis did <NEG>not</NEG> detect any RelA in nuclear extracts either before or after stimulation of T cells</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>The activation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) in intact cells is mechanistically <NEG>not</NEG> well understood</SCOPE> .

In HeLa cells as well as in B cells , TNF-alpha rapidly induced nuclear translocation primarily of p50-p65 , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> of c-rel</SCOPE> .

Surprisingly , even p65 , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> c-rel</SCOPE> , was phosphorylated after induction in vivo , suggesting that TNF-alpha selectively activates only specific NF-kappa B heteromers and that modifications regulate not only I kappa B molecules but also NF-kappa B molecules .

Most of these cells have rearranged their heavy-chain locus but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> their light chain genes</SCOPE> , suggesting that an active v-abl protein interferes with this differentiation step .

These increases occur <SCOPE>in the <NEG>absence</NEG> of protein synthesis</SCOPE> but are dependent on inactivation of the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase .

In contrast , <SCOPE>TPCK and TLCK did <NEG>not</NEG> block induction of an immediate-early gene encoding the transcription factor , Egr-1</SCOPE> .

& quot ; Plus & quot ; clones replicated the virus efficiently , whereas <SCOPE>& quot ; minus & quot ; clones did <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> .

These specific proteases are coordinately expressed and were present exclusively in the minus U937 clones , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in the plus clones</SCOPE> , as demonstrated in the case of cathepsin G .

To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control tal-1 expression , we investigated tal-1 chromatin structure in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines and in T-cell lines either with or <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG></SCOPE> tal-1 rearrangements .

Tal-1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in Jurkat , a T-cell line that expresses tal-1 <SCOPE>in the <NEG>absence</NEG> of apparent genomic alteration of the locus</SCOPE> .

HS II was <SCOPE>weak in hematopoietic cell lines , <NEG>absent</NEG> in Hela , and greatly enhanced in Jurkat</SCOPE> , suggesting that this region might be implicated in the cis-activation of tal-1 promoter 1b in this cell line .

This role for c-Myc in apoptosis is now confirmed in studies using a dominant <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> form of its heterodimeric binding partner</SCOPE> , Max , which we show here inhibits activation-induced apoptosis .

Further , coexpression of a reciprocally mutant Myc protein capable of forming functional heterodimers with the mutant Max can compensate for the dominant <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> activity</SCOPE> and restore activation-induced apoptosis .

Trans-activation of the TP1 promoter and of the BamHI C promoter has already been investigated in detail and appears to be mediated via protein-protein interactions and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by direct binding of EBNA-2 type A ( of EBV type 1 ) to the DNA</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>None</NEG> of the DNA fragments investigated</SCOPE> indicated interaction of EBNA-2 with the DNA via protein-protein interactions .

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> significant differences between EBNA-2-positive and EBNA-2-negative nuclear extracts</SCOPE> could be seen in the gel retardation assay under conditions that clearly showed binding of EBNA-2A to the TP1 promoter .

Finally , infectious virus stocks that were isogenic <SCOPE><NEG>except</NEG> for the LTR</SCOPE> were generated .

<SCOPE>Promoter constructs with mutations in these sequence elements were <NEG>no</NEG> longer expressed specifically in monocytes</SCOPE> .

Furthermore , multimerized region II sequence elements enhanced the activity of a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter in monocytic cells but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> other cell types tested</SCOPE> .

One of the Drosophila sequences , ttk , is a developmental control gene , while <SCOPE>a second does <NEG>not</NEG> contain a zinc finger region but encodes a structure important in oocyte development</SCOPE> .

Insertion of this chimeric promoter ( ISG15 LTR ) upstream of the human IFNA2 gene directed high levels of IFN synthesis in Tat-expressing cells , while <SCOPE>this promoter was <NEG>not</NEG> responsive to tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated activation</SCOPE> .

Virus isolated from IFNA-producing cells was able to replicate in the U937 cells but <SCOPE>did <NEG>not</NEG> replicate efficiently in U937 cells transduced with the IFNA gene</SCOPE> .

However , <SCOPE>PDTC <NEG>failed</NEG> to inhibit the endonuclease activity contained in the whole cell lysates</SCOPE> .

Pretreatment of HL-60 cells or thymocytes with 100-500 microM OP for 2 hr , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> 10-60 mM NAC</SCOPE> , suppressed subsequent occurrence of apoptosis induced by etoposide .

In this paper , we report that cross-linking of <SCOPE>CD28 ( but <NEG>not</NEG> CD2 , CD5 , LFA-1 , or</SCOPE> CD7 ) leads to an elevation of c-jun mRNA , with only minimal activation of c-fos expression .

CD28-dependent induction of c-jun expression requires protein tyrosine kinase activity , but <SCOPE>does <NEG>not</NEG> depend on activation of a phorbol ester-responsive protein kinase C or elevation of cytosolic calcium</SCOPE> .

Furthermore , <SCOPE>CD28-dependent elevation of c-jun mRNA does <NEG>not</NEG> appear to be mediated at the level of mRNA stability</SCOPE> .

A mechanism is suggested whereby expression of c-jun and junB , <SCOPE>in the <NEG>absence</NEG> of members of the fos family</SCOPE> , can prevent inappropriate activation of T cells caused by ligation of CD28 in the absence of a specific antigenic stimulus .

In such cells , DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B can be detected <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> intentional stimulation</SCOPE> .

By contrast , treatment of cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) will only block LPS-induced NF-kappa B , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the constitutive binding protein</SCOPE> .

Using LPS-free and serum-free conditions , constitutive NF-kappa B can be detected in different cell lines of the monocytic lineage ( HL60 , U937 , THP-1 , Mono Mac 1 and Mono Mac 6 ) , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in Molt 4 T cells or K562 stem cells</SCOPE> .

When ordered according to stage of maturation , <SCOPE>the amount of constitutive NF-kappa B was <NEG>not</NEG> increased in more mature cell lines</SCOPE> .

Furthermore , when inducing differentiation in Mono Mac 6 cells , with vitamin D3 , <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> change in constitutive or inducible NF-kappa B</SCOPE> can be detected .

<SCOPE>Constitutive NF-kappa B was <NEG>not</NEG> maintained by autocrine action of cytokines TNF , interleukin 6 , interleukin 10 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or macrophage colony-stimulating factor , since neutralizing antibodies did not reduce constitutive DNA-binding activity</SCOPE> .
Constitutive NF-kappa B was not maintained by autocrine action of cytokines TNF , interleukin 6 , interleukin 10 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or macrophage colony-stimulating factor , since <SCOPE>neutralizing antibodies did <NEG>not</NEG> reduce constitutive DNA-binding activity</SCOPE> .

Furthermore , <SCOPE>blockade of prostaglandin or leukotriene biosynthesis did <NEG>not</NEG> affect constitutive NF-kappa B</SCOPE> .

We demonstrate in a variety of cell types , including lymphocytes and endometrial stroma , that <SCOPE>Pit-1 is <NEG>not</NEG> involved in the regulation of dPRL promoter/reporter gene constructs carrying 3 kb 5 & apos</SCOPE> ; -flanking DNA .

Our experiments also show that <SCOPE>activated PR does <NEG>not</NEG> confer direct transcriptional control on the dPRL promoter</SCOPE> .

When we compared the activity of the transfected dPRL promoter in PRL-secreting and nonsecreting lymphoid cells , we found that <SCOPE>the 3 kb 5 & apos ; -flanking region of the dPRL promoter did <NEG>not</NEG> contain elements restricting expression to only those lymphocytes that produce PRL but allowed expression of fusion reporter genes irrespective of the status of the endogenous PRL gene</SCOPE> .

This was in sharp contrast to endometrial cells where 3 kb 5 & apos ; -flanking DNA conferred strong transcriptional activation on the dPRL promoter in decidualized endometrial stromal cells actively secreting PRL , but <SCOPE>did <NEG>not</NEG> allow transcription in undifferentiated non-PRL-secreting endometrial stromal cells</SCOPE> .

Activation of the dPRL promoter construct in these undifferentiated cells could however be induced by the addition of cAMP , <SCOPE>in the <NEG>absence</NEG> of progesterone</SCOPE> , suggesting that a signal transduced through the cAMP signaling pathway is a primary inducer of decidual PRL gene expression .

Although both kinases participate in regulating cell growth , there was <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> detectable activation of pp70S6K during TPA- or okadaic acid-induced monocytic differentiation</SCOPE> .

Moreover , rapamycin , an inhibitor of pp70S6K activation , had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect</SCOPE> on induction of EGR-1 expression .

In contrast , analysis of pp90rsk activity by phosphorylation of a peptide derived from S6 protein demonstrated stimulation of this kinase <SCOPE>in TPA-treated U-937 , and <NEG>not</NEG> TUR ,</SCOPE> cells .

Addition of rIL-2 fully restored the proliferative response and partially restored the production of IL-4 and IL-5 , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> that of other cytokines</SCOPE> .

Interestingly , PGE2 or di-butyryl ( Bt2 ) cAMP abolished the binding of NF-kappa B ( p50/p65 ) heterodimer to the kappa B sequence in cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with PMA/A23187</SCOPE> .

It seems therefore that PGE2 , by elevating cAMP levels , interferes with the activation pathway for NF-kappa B but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> for NF-AT , AP-1 or CLE0</SCOPE> binding protein .

Long-term inositol phosphate release , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> tyrosine kinase activity</SCOPE> , correlates with IL-2 secretion and NF-AT induction in anti-CD3-activated peripheral human T lymphocytes .

Although many second messengers have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for T cell activation in a number of model systems , <SCOPE>the rate-limiting step in peripheral T cells has <NEG>not</NEG> been demonstrated</SCOPE> .

To model effective versus ineffective CD3-mediated stimulation in peripheral T cells , we used two anti-CD3 mAbs that differ in their ability to stimulate purified T cells : OKT3 , which causes early second messenger generation but <SCOPE>is <NEG>unable</NEG> to activate T cells without a second signal</SCOPE> , and 64.1 , which stimulates T cell proliferation on its own .

Thus , NF-AT induction and IL-2 secretion were correlated with the levels of inositol phosphate release but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with gross levels of tyrosine kinase activity induced late following the response</SCOPE> .

Positive and <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulation of IL-2 gene expression</SCOPE> : role of multiple regulatory sites .

The results of this study suggest that <SCOPE>the NFAT ( -276 to -261 ) , the distal octamer ( -256 to -248 ) and the proximal octamer ( -75 to -66 ) sites <NEG>not</NEG> only act as enhancers of IL-2 gene transcription in the presence of cellular stimulation , but also have a silencing effect on IL-2 gene expression in resting cells</SCOPE> .

Furthermore , cyclosporin A , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> rapamycin</SCOPE> , blocked the synergistic induction of IL-8 expression achieved with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 costimulation .

These results indicate that a component or components of NF-AT have the potential to reconstitute NF ( P ) , whereas <SCOPE>NF-kappa B alone does <NEG>not</NEG> account for NF ( P ) in Jurkat crude extract</SCOPE> .

The two human GATA3 zinc fingers are encoded by two separate exons highly conserved with those of GATA1 , but <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> other structural homologies between these two genes</SCOPE> can be found .

<SCOPE>Cotransfection of NF-kappa B ( p50/p65 ) - or AP-1 ( c-Jun/c-Fos ) - expression vectors into Jurkat cells with a luciferase reporter containing the GM-CSF promoter did <NEG>not</NEG> stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter</SCOPE> .

In EMSAs , NF ( P ) binding was inhibited by the unlabeled NF-AT binding site but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by the unlabeled AP1 binding site</SCOPE> and purified NF-AT contained an activity that bound to the P sequence .

<SCOPE><NEG>Unlike</NEG> NF-AT</SCOPE> , NF ( P ) does not contain AP1 as its DNA binding component .
Unlike NF-AT , <SCOPE>NF ( P ) does <NEG>not</NEG> contain AP1 as its DNA binding component</SCOPE> .

Pretreatment of cells with protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the dominant <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> allele of c-Raf-1 ( Raf 301 )</SCOPE> inhibited I kappa B alpha degradation , NF-kappa B binding , and transactivation of kappa B reporter constructs by hypoxia .

In comparison to other activators of NF-kappa B such as phorbol myristate acetate or tumor necrosis factor , <SCOPE>we did <NEG>not</NEG> detect changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of I kappa B alpha following treatment with either of these agents</SCOPE> .

In most HIV-1 isolates in which <SCOPE>this PU box was <NEG>not</NEG> conserved</SCOPE> , it was replaced by a binding site for the related factor Ets1 .

Factors binding to site C ( nt 4681 to 4701 ) had a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of factors binding to site B , <SCOPE><NEG>except</NEG> for PU.1/Spi-1</SCOPE> .

We found that transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR by v-src was more sensitive to mutations of the proximal , <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> the distal , kappa</SCOPE> B element .

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> factor ( Nef )</SCOPE> has been shown to down-regulate the transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in vitro .

Stimulation of T cells with tumor necrosis factor , interleukin-1 , or lipopolysaccharide resulted in the <SCOPE>recruitment of transcriptional factors to a similar level whether or <NEG>not</NEG> the cells expressed the nef gene</SCOPE> .

On the other hand , stimulation of T cells by mitogens or antibodies to the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) -CD3 complex resulted in the down-regulation of transcriptional factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in cells expressing the nef gene compared with cells <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> expressing the nef gene</SCOPE> .

Because <SCOPE>the Nef protein does <NEG>not</NEG> affect the surface expression of the CD3-TCR complex</SCOPE> , we conclude that the Nef protein down-regulates the transcriptional factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in T cells in vitro through an effect on the TCR-dependent signal transduction pathway .

<SCOPE>NF-kappa B activation by TNF alpha was <NEG>not</NEG> correlated with cell differentiation or proliferation</SCOPE> .

In a NGF-responsive rat pheochromocytoma cell line , PC12 , PMA activated NF-kappa B , whereas <SCOPE>NGF did <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> .

In other neuroblastoma cell lines , such <SCOPE>as SK-N-Be ( 2 ) , the <NEG>lack</NEG> of PMA induction of</SCOPE> differentiation was correlated with the lack of NF-kappa B activation .
In other neuroblastoma cell lines , such as SK-N-Be ( 2 ) , the lack of PMA induction of differentiation was correlated <SCOPE>with the <NEG>lack</NEG> of NF-kappa B activation</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>NF-kappa B was <NEG>not</NEG> activated by retinoic acid , which induced morphological differentiation of all the neuroblastoma cell lines used in the present study</SCOPE> .

Thus , <SCOPE>NF-kappa B activation was <NEG>not</NEG> required for neuroblastoma cell differentiation</SCOPE> .

Furthermore , the results obtained with TNF alpha proved that <SCOPE>NF-kappa B activation was <NEG>not</NEG> sufficient for induction of neuroblastoma differentiation</SCOPE> .

Although <SCOPE>these heterodimers do <NEG>not</NEG> recognize a classical thyroid hormone response element ( TRE ) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides ( DR+4 ) , PPAR behaves as a dominant negative regulator of thyroid hormone ( TH ) action</SCOPE> .
Although these heterodimers do not recognize a classical thyroid hormone response element ( TRE ) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides ( DR+4 ) , PPAR behaves as a dominant <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulator of thyroid hormone ( TH ) action</SCOPE> .

However , a TH-dependent positive effect is elicited by selective interaction of the THR beta-PPAR but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the THR alpha-PPAR heterodimer</SCOPE> with a novel TRE ( DR+2 ) .

Ii kappa B-1 is a positive regulatory element in B-cell lines and in the Ii-expressing T-cell line , H9 , but acts as a <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulatory element</SCOPE> in myelomonocytic and glia cell lines .

In vivo protein-DNA contacts are detectable at Ii kappa B-1 in cell lines in which this site is functional as either a positive or <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulator</SCOPE> .

Electrophoretic mobility supershift assays determine that members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors can bind to this site in vitro and that DNA-binding complexes that contain p50 , p52 , p65 , and cRel correlate with positive regulation whereas the presence of p50 correlates with <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulation</SCOPE> .

Ii kappa B-2 is a site of positive regulation in B-cell lines and a site of <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulation</SCOPE> in H9 T cells , myelomonocytic , and glial cell lines .

Again , in vitro supershift studies indicate that the presence of p50 , p52 , p65 , and cRel correlates with positive function whereas the presence of only p50 and p52 correlates with <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> function</SCOPE> .

Nuclei from GATA-1- mutant embryonic stem cells can still be reprogrammed to express their globin genes in erythroid heterokaryons , indicating that <SCOPE>de novo induction of GATA-1 is <NEG>not</NEG> required for globin gene activation following cell fusion</SCOPE> .

1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 inhibited CD23 expression in U937 cells , yet <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to modulate CD23 expression in B cells</SCOPE> .

Furthermore , 1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 induced 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression and metabolic activity in both U937 cells and lectin-activated T cells , yet <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA or its metabolic activity in B cells</SCOPE> .

One 63-kDa isoform , termed I kappa B gamma-1 , which <SCOPE><NEG>lacks</NEG> 59 amino acids C-terminal to ankyrin repeat 7</SCOPE> , has a novel 35-amino acid C terminus encoded by an alternative reading frame of the p105 gene .

<SCOPE>A 55-kDa isoform , I kappa B gamma-2 , <NEG>lacks</NEG> the 190 C-terminal amino acids of p70I kappa B gamma .</SCOPE>

The <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> in I kappa B gamma-1 and I kappa B gamma-2 of a protein kinase A site whose phosphorylation</SCOPE> modulates p70I kappa B gamma inhibitory activity suggests that alternative RNA splicing may be used to generate I kappa B gamma isoforms that respond differently to intracellular signals .

Deletion of the 5 & apos ; -most Ets site had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect</SCOPE> on binding to GABP alpha/GABP beta , but it eliminated a .

We conclude that although <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> of the two 5 & apos ; -most Ets sites alone binds nuclear protein</SCOPE> , they appear to act as modulators which control the pattern of Ets proteins that bind the alpha 4 gene promoter .

In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the TF site bound translated c-Rel and p65 homodimers but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> p50/p65 heterodimers or p50 homodimers</SCOPE> .

In fact , under low-ionic-strength conditions , <SCOPE>the TF complex did <NEG>not</NEG> migrate with translated p50/p65 dimers but instead comigrated with c-Rel/p65 dimers</SCOPE> .

Irreversible terminal differentiation induced by VD3 is associated with down regulation of the expression of c-myc and upregulation of the expression of c-fos and c-jun , but <SCOPE>ML-9 did <NEG>not</NEG> affect the expression of these oncogenes appreciably</SCOPE> .

Using this system , we observed that CD28 stimulation by B7-transfected CHO cells induced a proliferative response in T cells that <SCOPE>was <NEG>not</NEG> accompanied by measurable IL-2 production</SCOPE> .

However , subsequent analysis of transcription factor generation revealed that B7 stimulation induced both activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) complexes , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> NF-AT</SCOPE> .

In contrast , engagement of the TCR by class II MHC/superantigen , either with or <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG></SCOPE> CD28 ligation , resulted in the induction of NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF-kappaB as well as IL-2 production .

This revealed that NF-kappaB generation was sensitive to chloroquine , an inhibitor of acidic sphingomyelinase , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor</SCOPE> , wortmannin .

However , the NF-IL6 gene is expressed in a variety of nonmyeloid cell types and is strongly inducible in response to inflammatory stimuli , making <SCOPE>it an <NEG>unlikely</NEG> candidate to have an exclusive role as a combinatorial differentiation switch during myelopoiesis in human cells</SCOPE> .

These data suggest that activated NFAT is involved in the effector function of eTh2 cells and that the <SCOPE><NEG>failure</NEG> of eTh1 cells to produce IL-4 in response to an antigen</SCOPE> is due , at least partially , to a failure to induce high-level transcription of the IL-4 gene by NFAT .

A <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> role for phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T-cell antigen receptor function</SCOPE> .

BACKGROUND : A delicate balance between <SCOPE>positive and <NEG>negative</NEG> regulatory mechanisms</SCOPE> during T-cell activation determines the specificity and magnitude of an immune response .

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) is activated by a diverse set of receptors that determine T-cell function , including the T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , the costimulatory receptor CD28 , and <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulators of T-cell activation such as CTLA-4</SCOPE> .

RESULTS : <SCOPE>Certain aspects of TCR responses such as the induction of transcriptional activity of AP1 and serum response factor were <NEG>not</NEG> affected by expression of the mutant forms of PI 3-kinase</SCOPE> .

We found , however , that PI 3-kinase profoundly influenced the transactivation capacity of & apos ; nuclear factor of activated T cells & apos ; ( NF-AT ) elicited by the TCR : expression of an activated form of PI 3-kinase inhibited TCR-mediated NF-AT responses , whereas expression of a dominant <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> mutant of PI 3-kinase</SCOPE> potently enhanced TCR-controlled NF-AT induction .

<SCOPE>These effects of PI 3-kinase were <NEG>not</NEG> mediated by previously identified PI 3-kinase effectors , such as protein kinase B , a positive regulator of PI 3-kinase , or the GTPase Rac , and are therefore likely to involve a novel , as yet unknown , effector molecule .</SCOPE>

CONCLUSIONS : Our results establish that PI 3-kinase can both positively and negatively regulate T-cell function , and uncover a previously unrecognized function for PI 3-kinase in T cells as a selective <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> regulator of TCR-signalling events</SCOPE> and therefore as a determinant of T-cell homeostasis .

To assess whether this inhibition was mediated via modulation of the cellular transcription factor , NF-kappa B , we carried out gel shift analysis on nuclear extracts prepared under different conditions of cell stimulation <SCOPE>in the presence or <NEG>absence</NEG> of ascorbate , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , or zidovudine (</SCOPE> AZT ) .

Contrary to the results in Jurkat cells , <SCOPE>PDTC did <NEG>not</NEG> inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF kappaB activation in astrocytes</SCOPE> ; instead PDTC itself induces NF kappaB activation in astrocytes , and this may be related to scavenging of endogenously produced NO by the PDTC iron complex .

Triggering of HLA class II antigens by the anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) L243 significantly ( P & lt ; 0.05 ) and differentially enhanced the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) by the non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma cells Ri-I , Ci-I , and Sc-I , which are at a distinct stage of B-cell differentiation , and by the more mature Burkitt lymphoma cell Raji ; in contrast , <SCOPE>it did <NEG>not</NEG> induce TNF-alpha release by the pre-B leukemia cells Nalm-6 and BV173</SCOPE> .

Secreted TNF-alpha mediated the enhancement of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) and activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) binding activity ; in fact , <SCOPE>the triggering of HLA-DR antigens in the presence of antihuman TNF-alpha-neutralizing antibodies did <NEG>not</NEG> upregulate NF-kappa B and AP-1</SCOPE> .

These results indicate that histamine activates several mechanisms involved in the induction of differentiation , such as cAMP and c-fos production , but <SCOPE><NEG>fails</NEG> to promote differentiation of U937 cells , apparently due to the rapid desensitization of H2</SCOPE> receptors .

As determined by transient expression and RNA analyses , the activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) also increased <SCOPE>rates of transcription from the wild-type DRA promoter but <NEG>not</NEG> from a DRA promoter bearing clustered point mutations in the X2 box</SCOPE> .

Since the co-expression with a dominant <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> c-Fos</SCOPE> abolished the responsiveness to TPA , we conclude that activated transcription of the DRA gene depends on interactions between the X2 box and NF-X2 , which contains c-Fos .

During the differentiation of naive CD4 ( + ) T cells isolated from T cell receptor transgenic mice , GATA-3 gene expression was up-regulated in developing Th2 cells , but was down-regulated in Th1 cells , and antigen- or cAMP-activated Th2 <SCOPE>cells ( but <NEG>not</NEG> Th1 cells )</SCOPE> expressed the GATA-3 protein .

Cytokine-stimulated cell surface expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 , CD106 ) and E-selectin ( ELAM-1 , CD62E ) , but not of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 , CD54 ) , was time- and dose-dependently inhibited by TCP succinate but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by TCP or TCP acetate</SCOPE> .

TCP succinate ( 20 microM , 72 h ) , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> TCP ( 200 microM , 72 h ) ,</SCOPE> reduced U-937 cell adhesion to TNF-alpha-stimulated ( 10 U/ml , 6 h ) HUVEC by 30 % ( P & lt ; 0.025 ) and to IL-1 beta-stimulated HUVEC by 56 % ( P & lt ; 0.010 ) .

Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays of HUVEC nuclear proteins revealed a decrease in TNF-alpha-stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation after pretreatment of HUVEC with TCP succinate but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with TCP , TCP acetate , or</SCOPE> succinate alone .

Although NAC reduced nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation in EC as measured by gel-shift assays using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the consensus NF-kappa B binding sites of the VCAM-1 gene ( VCAM-NF-kappa B ) , the antioxidant had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> appreciable effect</SCOPE> when an oligomer corresponding to the consensus NF-kappa B binding site of the E-selectin gene ( E-selectin-NF-kappa B ) was used .

IFN-gamma triggers a well-defined signal transduction pathway , which although <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> directly stimulated by monocyte adherence to fibronectin or arginine-glycine-aspartate ( RGD ) -coated substrata</SCOPE> , was enhanced significantly in these matrix-adherent cells .

<SCOPE>The sophisticated control of Rel/NF-kappa B activity is <NEG>not</NEG> surprising since this transcription factor is involved in a wide array of cellular responses to extracellular cues , associated with growth , development , apoptosis , and pathogen invasion .</SCOPE>

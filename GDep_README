GDep is a dependency parser for biomedical text trained on TsujiiLab's GENIA treebank.  GDep was developed at ICT (University of Southern California) and Tsujii Laboratory (University of Tokyo).  GDep includes the GENIA Tagger, developed by Yoshimasa Tsuruoka at Tsujii Laboratory.

1. How to build 
  (if you are using Windows, there's no need to build; 
   an executable is already provided: gdep-win32.exe)

  You need gcc to build GDep.

  % make

  This should produce an executable named gdep.

  If you encounter errors with hash, try commenting out "#define USE_HASH_MAP"
  in "maxent.h".


2. How to use

  Prepare a text file containing one sentence per line, then

  % ./gdep < TEXTFILE > PARSEDFILE

  The parser outputs a dependency tree for each sentence in the input
  file.  In addition, the following information produced by the
  GENIA Tagger is included in the parser output: base forms, 
  part-of-speech tags, chunk tags and named entity tags.  

  From the GENIA Tagger README:
  Chunks and named entities are represented in the IOB2 format (B for BEGIN,
  I for INSIDE, and O for OUTSIDE). The named entity tagger is trained on
  the NLPBA data set [3], which contains five semantic classes (DNA, RNA,
  cell_line, cell_type, and PROTEIN).


 2.1 Tokenization

  The parser uses the GENIA Tagger tokenization.  Tokenization can
  be turned off using the -nt option.  
  
  The following information is taken from the GENIA Tagger README:

  This tagger tokenizes the sentence with almost the same policy as the
  upenn tokenizer (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/tokenizer.sed). 

  If you don't want the tagger to perform tokenization, use -nt option.
  In that case, the input sentences should be already tokenized by your
  own tokenizer with white spaces.

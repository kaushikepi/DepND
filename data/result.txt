Sure , it 's all based on characters created by the good doctor years ago , but it all feels like one big bathroom joke that <SCOPE>is <NEG>n't</NEG> funny in the very least</SCOPE> .

As mom plans to host a big party at home for her obsessive compulsive neat freak boss ( Mr. Humberfloob , played by Sean Hayes ) , the kids are told <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to ruin the house</SCOPE> , and are left with a noodling , overweight babysitter who falls asleep faster than Granpa does on The Simpsons .

<SCOPE>Seuss big screen adaptation was <NEG>n't</NEG></SCOPE> anything all that hot either ( The Grinch ) , at least it felt like it had some of that Dr. Seuss heart to it , and Jim Carrey at least brought something to the role that so many thought he did n't belong in .

<SCOPE>This however , does <NEG>n't</NEG> work in the least</SCOPE> .

But <SCOPE>this review is <NEG>n't</NEG> about my clearly irrational desire to live in the world of Dr. Suess</SCOPE> , it 's about how Bo Welch 's ( henceforth referred to as Bo Grinch ) cinematic adaptation of Seuss ' Cat in the Hat has robbed me of my childhood memories .

Drawing things as <SCOPE>they 've <NEG>never</NEG> been drawn</SCOPE> has also helped to maintain the timeless nature of Seuss ' work , and avoids the pitfalls of stereotypes and geographic isolation .

It seemed to me that Myers forgot that <SCOPE>he is <NEG>n't</NEG> on Saturday Night Live , playing to a largely adult audience</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>This simply was <NEG>n't</NEG> the venue for him to enlist his own brand of creative devices .</SCOPE>

Spencer Breslin ( Conrad ) and Dakota Fanning ( Sally ) are just children <SCOPE>themselves , and ca <NEG>n't</NEG> be held responsible for the awkwardness that is brought about by Bo Grinch and his grinchy ways</SCOPE> .

( Yes , I realize that I 'm the same person who 's always saying <SCOPE>there is <NEG>n't</NEG> enough nudity</SCOPE> , but even I ascribe to some sense of good taste ) The references to a dirty hoe and a Playboy centerfold were entirely unnecessary .

I realize that <SCOPE>younger children might <NEG>not</NEG> get them</SCOPE> , but then WHY include them ?

<SCOPE>Adults have <NEG>never</NEG> found this necessary to enjoy Seuss ' books</SCOPE> ; and spoiling the pristine , although sometimes misunderstood , image of the Cat in the Hat is a low blow -- even for Mike Myers .

<SCOPE>I <NEG>never</NEG> even got to see what it would be like to fly a kite in the house</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>I <NEG>never</NEG> got to see the Things bump the kites on the wall</SCOPE> !

Ok , <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> everyone</SCOPE> agrees with me : dragonfire88 , Bruguru .

Plot Details : This opinion reveals <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> details</SCOPE> about the movie 's plot .

I consider myself a moderate person that <SCOPE>is <NEG>not</NEG> overly protective or overly liberal</SCOPE> .

Shame on me for <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> checking the rating before taking the kids to the theater</SCOPE> .

I had assumed ( like I 'm sure many of you would ) that it would be rated G. <SCOPE>It 's <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> .

The movie is <SCOPE><NEG>absent</NEG> 4-letter words</SCOPE> and explicit sex scenes , but the inappropriate-for-children content and mature innuendos in this movie overshadow the story line and plot .

I later discovered my 11 year old understood all of them ( I wish <SCOPE>he had <NEG>n't</NEG> ) , my 8 year old understood about 1/2 of them</SCOPE> , and my 4 year old is still innocent enough to understood none of them ( except the `` butt scene `` ) .

The most memorable moments that <SCOPE>I did <NEG>not</NEG> appreciate</SCOPE> are the `` butt scene `` - where the cat was outfitted with a large bare bottom , using the term `` Dirty Ho `` - referring to a dirty gardening hoe , and an acronym for the cat 's vehicle is S.H.I.T .

The story line and plot itself is poor and <SCOPE>does <NEG>n't</NEG> flow nearly as smooth as a Dr. Seuss 's classic should</SCOPE> .

I WOULD <SCOPE><NEG>NOT</NEG></SCOPE> SEE THIS HERE OR THERE , I WOULD NOT SEE THIS AGAIN ANYWHERE ...

I guess I just thought that this movie would be as good as the Grinch , but unfortunately , <SCOPE>it was <NEG>n't</NEG></SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>This movie does <NEG>not</NEG> even come close to being half as good as How the Grinch Stole Christmas was</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>It 's <NEG>not</NEG> the acting that makes this movie bad .</SCOPE>

Sally <SCOPE>does <NEG>n't</NEG> know how to have fun and Conrad only knows how to have fun</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>I especially did <NEG>n't</NEG> like the fact that there seem to be a couple of sexual innuendos unappropriate for children and completely unnecessary in the film</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>The make-up was <NEG>n't</NEG> too good either .</SCOPE>

The costume and make-up of Cat look so fake that <SCOPE>it 's <NEG>not</NEG> even funny</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>The setting was <NEG>n't</NEG> exactly what I had envisioned either .</SCOPE>

<SCOPE>It did <NEG>n't</NEG> look like it had just `` leapt `` out of the book</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>They wo <NEG>n't</NEG> know any different</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>Adults and anyone who has ever read the book wo <NEG>n't</NEG> be that impressed</SCOPE> .

Wait to get this movie for the kids when it comes out on video , <SCOPE>it 's <NEG>not</NEG> really worth seeing in theaters</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>I <NEG>never</NEG> met the Doc</SCOPE> , but I have to believe after reading as much as I have of his material , the cat he had in mind was not a vulgar pervert with bad taste in music .
I never met the Doc , but I have to believe after reading as much as I have of his material , the cat he had in <SCOPE>mind was <NEG>not</NEG> a vulgar pervert with bad taste in music</SCOPE> .

While <SCOPE>they <NEG>never</NEG> actually said any curse words</SCOPE> , They got way too close on several occasions .

Based on the load at the theatre I was at , and the fact that it 's been on for about 5 days now , I 'd guess that approx 1000 kids are going to be walking around school looking at one another and quoting the cat when he said `` SON OF A BI ... '' , <SCOPE><NEG>never</NEG> actually saying it</SCOPE> , but getting to close .

Lots of kids will be saying with <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> understanding of what it was meant to imply , but would you want them to walk up in front of your parents</SCOPE> , their teacher , someone at church , or someone in a store and spout off that phrase ? ?

What <SCOPE>I did <NEG>n't</NEG> like</SCOPE> was the over the top job they did on Alec 's character making him the opposite of what the children 's mother thought he was .

Kelly Preston : If I really have to explain why she is in the `` good `` section , then <SCOPE>you have <NEG>n't</NEG> seen her</SCOPE> .

OK , I 'll give credit here , although <SCOPE>I really did <NEG>n't</NEG> like the path</SCOPE> they took to get there , the story line was basically the same .

The mother who was starting to doubt <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> only her ability to raise her son , but also her son 's ability to accept responsibility and do the things we was asked to do , now had now doubt that they would all be just fine together</SCOPE> .

Overall , this would be an ok movie for older kids , maybe , if they had a firm grasp on the understanding that some of the things you see on a movie <SCOPE>are <NEG>not</NEG> acceptable in the real world</SCOPE> .

Being a long time Doc fan , <SCOPE>I did <NEG>n't</NEG></SCOPE> like the Grinch with Jim Carey , but it was a masterpiece compared to this one .

I really hope that <SCOPE>Horton Hear A Who is <NEG>n't</NEG> up for the next book to be butchered</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>I 'm <NEG>not</NEG> sure if he should be angrier at his widow for giving studios the rights to his stories , or to the studios for stabbing his widow in the back when she trusted them .</SCOPE>

In THE GRINCH she exercised a lot of , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> enough</SCOPE> , control .

In THE CAT IN THE HAT , the producers and writers took the rights they had and ran with them , putting things in that <SCOPE>the widow , let alone Dr. Seuss , did <NEG>n't</NEG> and would n't have endorsed</SCOPE> .

A cute , innocent story ( though some Freudians will argue that <SCOPE>it 's <NEG>not</NEG> such</SCOPE> ) was taken and butchered by writers who feel that the only way to make this story work is to appeal to the lowest common denominator .

You wind up <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> disliking</SCOPE> , but hating , all the characters in the movie .

This movie is allegedly for kids , but <SCOPE>I do <NEG>not</NEG> think it 's suitable for most kids under 10</SCOPE> .

I am a Michael Myer fan and although <SCOPE>`` The Grinch `` was <NEG>not</NEG> all that great</SCOPE> , I found it watchable .

<SCOPE>I could <NEG>n't</NEG> believe it</SCOPE> , I was insulted .

Plot Details : This opinion reveals <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> details</SCOPE> about the movie 's plot .

<SCOPE>The plot is <NEG>not</NEG> the books .</SCOPE>

I know that <SCOPE>movies are <NEG>not</NEG> supposed to be fully like the book</SCOPE> but when practically every child ( as well as adult ) in America has read the Dr. Seuss books , this is unforgivable .

The people who adapt his work to the big screen seem to have <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> clue what it 's like to be a child</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>Neither</NEG> does The Cat ( Mike Myers ) in the live-action version of `` The Cat In The Hat . `` Plot When he comes to the Walden residence</SCOPE> , he scares young Sally ( Dakota Fanning ) and Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ) .

If her children are unruly , or <SCOPE>the party <NEG>fails</NEG> in any other way , Hank promises Joan that she will lose her job</SCOPE> .

The Walden children are surrounded by people who <SCOPE>should <NEG>never</NEG> be their role models</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>Not</NEG> one adult</SCOPE> comes across as a sympathetic character .

<SCOPE>The adults are <NEG>not</NEG> the least bit appealing</SCOPE> .

As for Myers , he has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> chemistry</SCOPE> with Fanning or Breslin , who are the best parts of this movie .

<SCOPE>He comes to the home <NEG>not</NEG> as the spirit of fun , but as the spirit of a stand-up comic .</SCOPE>

<SCOPE>This feline does <NEG>n't</NEG> show Sally and Conrad how to have fun</SCOPE> ; he shows them how to be consumers .

This film has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> direction</SCOPE> ; it 's just a series of skits that just barely run long enough to constitute a feature-length film .

<SCOPE>`` The Cat In The Hat `` otherwise does <NEG>not</NEG> have any true sense of playfulness</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>Do <NEG>n't</NEG> introduce children to the work of Dr. Seuss with the live-action `` The Cat In The Hat</SCOPE> . `` Read the books to them , or let them read the books to you .

This movie is <SCOPE><NEG>NOT</NEG> for young children , which is rather disappointing</SCOPE> because thats who would have watched the movie had it been any good .

<SCOPE>The jokes were <NEG>not</NEG> that funny .</SCOPE>

It was <SCOPE><NEG>NOT</NEG> worth</SCOPE> the money paid .

Apparently , <SCOPE>it is nt <NEG>nor</NEG> should it even be compared to Dead Poets Society .</SCOPE>

<SCOPE><NEG>Not</NEG> even the films young cast of Kirsten Dunst , Ginnifer Goodwin , Julia Stiles , and Maggie Gyllenhaal along with Dominic West , John Slattery , and Marcia Gay Harden could save this disappointment called Mona Lisa Smile .</SCOPE>

The next day , Watson gives paintings that werent in the required syllabus for the students that leads to the schools news editor Betty Warren ( Kirsten Dunst ) to saying the painting is appalling since it has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> structure or textures</SCOPE> .

When Katherine was grading papers , she meets up with Joan who questioned her grade as Katherine just wants her to <SCOPE>state her own opinion and <NEG>not</NEG> someone elses</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>Not</NEG> to appreciate but look beneath the paintings , notably Jackson Pollock .</SCOPE>

After a party where Katherine revealed that she was once engaged but <SCOPE><NEG>never</NEG> made it to the altar</SCOPE> , Betty goes into another rant over Katherines life and finds herself alienated by the rest of the student .

Betty becomes a thorn to some students , notably the insecure Constance as she tells her that Charlie had been going out with someone , which <SCOPE>turned out <NEG>not</NEG> to be true as Betty finds her marriage crumbling</SCOPE> .

The students began to ponder their own direction in life including Betty as Katherine is wondering if she should stay <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> any sense of compromise</SCOPE> .

The film has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> true</SCOPE> , linear structure and leaves everything in a very disappointing way .

Newell still should be given credit for trying to make things interesting since the pacing of the film is attentive but it s given a weak script with <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> sense of a singular direction to begin with</SCOPE> .

Even in the tense , dramatic moments , it does nt feel suspenseful <SCOPE><NEG>nor</NEG> in the lighter moments , it comes out as fluff</SCOPE> .

Julia Roberts <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> a doubt</SCOPE> , is a good actress depending on what film she does .

Unfortunately in period pieces like Mary Reilly  and Michael Collins , <SCOPE>she has <NEG>never</NEG> fared well and in Mona Lisa Smile</SCOPE> , she does nt really bring anything that we have nt seen before .


Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers an excellent performance although <SCOPE>she is <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> the scene-stealer many are saying .

In the films site , they say she is fragile and all of this junk yet I <SCOPE><NEG>never</NEG> found out why she sleeps with these men or anything</SCOPE> .

It was very clear from the start this film was made to get some attention for the Oscars but after the recent snub from the Golden Globes ( <SCOPE><NEG>except</NEG> for Best Original Song for Elton John</SCOPE> , which is an all right song ) ; it s likely not to get any Oscar nominations for anyone involved except the costume and production designs .

What <SCOPE>I do <NEG>n't</NEG> get</SCOPE> is why ghosts in these situations completely terrorize the people they have chosen to help them .

Also , the nightmares Tom Cruise had about killing the Native Americans <SCOPE><NEG>never</NEG> really comes into full focus</SCOPE> .

He seems to have just had these nightmares , but after these nightmares , <SCOPE>these actions do <NEG>n't</NEG> come in anywhere else in the movies</SCOPE> .

And he blames this one guy that led the attack for all this , and Cruise himself shot the natives <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> question</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>He did <NEG>n't</NEG> even really put up a good fight against his commander 's orders</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>He does <NEG>n't</NEG> even get tempted not to shoot</SCOPE> .
He does n't even get tempted <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to shoot</SCOPE> .

I wish <SCOPE>I had <NEG>n't</NEG> seen this movie</SCOPE> .

I wish that <SCOPE>Roger Ebert had <NEG>n't</NEG> given it 3 out of 4 stars and said</SCOPE> , this is one of those rare Christmas comedies that has a heart , a brain and a wicked sense of humor , and it charms the socks right off the mantelpiece .

I 'm <SCOPE>thinking <NEG>no</NEG> because I walked out of that theater feeling like I had wasted 95 minutes of my time</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>Santa does <NEG>n't</NEG> know that he 's taken Buddy back to the North Pole until he crawls out of the bag in the Elves Workshop</SCOPE> .

The thing is , <SCOPE>little Buddy is <NEG>n't</NEG> so little .</SCOPE>

After years <SCOPE>of <NEG>not</NEG> fitting in</SCOPE> , Papa Elf finally tells Buddy that he 's adopted .

His father Walter ( James Caan ) ( who <SCOPE>does <NEG>n't</NEG> know about Buddy ) lives in a magical place</SCOPE> ( New York ) and his mother Susan ( Jane Bradbury ) died shortly after he was born .

<SCOPE>Buddy does <NEG>n't</NEG> get the joyous reunion that he was expecting</SCOPE> .

For days , <SCOPE>his father does <NEG>n't</NEG> believe that he 's his long , lost son</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>Not</NEG> knowing what to do</SCOPE> , he takes Buddy home to the family .

He 's immediately smitten <SCOPE>with her but <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> because she has a hot body .

Believe me , <SCOPE>you wo <NEG>n't</NEG> care</SCOPE> .

You 'll be asking yourself , is there a way to leave this movie <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> offending my child and husband</SCOPE> ? ? ?

Of course in both of those circumstances , <SCOPE>he was the actor and <NEG>not</NEG> the director .</SCOPE>

Maybe the man is meant to <SCOPE>be an actor and <NEG>not</NEG> a director</SCOPE> because if he stays on the directing path , he 's surely headed for a disasterous career ending ...

Farting - that was <SCOPE>fun ( <NEG>not</NEG> )</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>I do <NEG>n't</NEG> think that I 'll ever be able to watch SNL again for fear of a headache</SCOPE> .

The way he played the character of Buddy <SCOPE>was <NEG>n't</NEG> what I was expecting</SCOPE> .

Instead of the wide-eye innocence that you get with <SCOPE>other <NEG>not</NEG> so clued in movie characters ( think Tom Hanks in Big</SCOPE> ) , what you get here is a one-track , annoying and irritating male .

I kept on thinking - if <SCOPE>Jon Faverau ca <NEG>n't</NEG> direct you</SCOPE> , do something for yourself dude !

But <SCOPE>he did <NEG>n't</NEG></SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>It 's <NEG>not</NEG> like there was any Oscar-stretching material that they were having to deal with</SCOPE> .

And to top it all off , there was <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> memorable soundtrack</SCOPE> .

The movie had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> heart</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> heart=the inability for me to overlook the mistakes made by Jon Favreau 's poor directing</SCOPE> .

Ok let me get this out of the way : I did <SCOPE><NEG>NOT</NEG></SCOPE> like this movie .

<SCOPE>I do <NEG>n't</NEG> think hes funny at all on SNL</SCOPE> , but I was willing to give him a chance .

The special effects and props are EXTREMELY low budget and so <SCOPE>fake its <NEG>not</NEG> even funny</SCOPE> .

You can clearly tell what parts were filmed on a sound stage , as the backgrounds are blatently fake , <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effort</SCOPE> was put into them .

<SCOPE>I 'm <NEG>not</NEG> going to bother spelling out what happens in the movie because enough people mentioned it already</SCOPE> .

Here are the funny parts : he drinks an entire 2 liter of coke and lets out a 30 second ( or so ) belch ; a scene where he tries to put a star on top of the christmas tree and it comes crashing down on him ; he attacks a fake Santa at a store because its <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the real Santa</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> really , stop laughing .</SCOPE>

There is <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> bad language</SCOPE> at all , nothing derogatory , no put downs , nothing sexual .

I 'm actually <SCOPE>surprised Disney did <NEG>n't</NEG> make this movie since Disney movies are n't funny and geared towards kids</SCOPE> .
I 'm actually surprised Disney did n't make this movie since <SCOPE>Disney movies are <NEG>n't</NEG> funny and geared towards kids</SCOPE> .

After watching this flick , <SCOPE>I will <NEG>never</NEG> watch Will Ferrell again</SCOPE> .

He 's just <SCOPE><NEG>NOT</NEG></SCOPE> funny .

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> , not really .</SCOPE>
<SCOPE>No , <NEG>not</NEG> really .</SCOPE>

Actors are brain dead , rely on childish type humor to make the audience laugh , and <SCOPE>you do <NEG>n't</NEG> do a very good job convincing the audience even for a moment that this is a fantasy flick</SCOPE> .

Adults who like clean humor <SCOPE>and Disney type <NEG>not</NEG> funny movies</SCOPE> will probably like this .

<SCOPE>I do <NEG>n't</NEG> recommend this to anybody looking for a serious laugh , or even a little bad language .</SCOPE>

Obviously this is just my opinion , <SCOPE>I do <NEG>n't</NEG> expect others to feel this way , but if you like adult humor , decent acting , a movie with a plot , and a believeable movie set , then avoid this movie like the plague .</SCOPE>

But <SCOPE>Will Ferrell is <NEG>not</NEG> the man for the job .</SCOPE>

But <SCOPE>Ferrell , another of those `` Saturday Night Live `` vets who go for nothing beyond the quick laugh , ca <NEG>n't</NEG> milk a routine to save his life</SCOPE> .

If you 're a discriminating adult , <SCOPE>Elf probably wo <NEG>n't</NEG> be much more palatable</SCOPE> .

While I liked what they did , <SCOPE>it just was <NEG>n't</NEG> the same .</SCOPE>

There were loads of one-liners , funny faces , pranks , and even a few brushes with vulgarity ( <SCOPE><NEG>none</NEG> of which would compel me to deprive my own kids of the pleasure , had I any</SCOPE> ) .

That 's basically it , <SCOPE><NEG>except</NEG> for some line of bologna</SCOPE> about showing the boy ( Spencer Breslin ) how bad it is to make a mess . . by making a bigger one , and showing the girl ( Dakota Fanning ) how not to be so uptight .
That 's basically it , except for some line of bologna about showing the boy ( Spencer Breslin ) how bad it is to make a mess . . by making a bigger one , and showing the girl ( Dakota Fanning ) how <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to be so uptight</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> kidding</SCOPE> .

One of my favorite parts of the original was when they went on the big scavenger hunt for the moss-covered three handled family gredunza , and they have to mark all the places where <SCOPE>it is <NEG>n't</NEG></SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>It is <NEG>n't</NEG> in this keyhole ( No</SCOPE> ? ) and it is n't on my knee ( Hmm , mark the keyhole K-300 , mark the knee 57-G ! ) Okay , it 's a little sad that I still remember that .
It is n't in this keyhole ( No ? ) and <SCOPE>it is <NEG>n't</NEG> on my knee ( Hmm , mark the keyhole K-300 , mark the knee 57-G ! ) Okay , it 's a little sad that I still remember that</SCOPE> .

But I was saddened that <SCOPE>they could <NEG>n't</NEG> have found a way to at least incorporate this into the new one</SCOPE> .

As if <SCOPE>this all were <NEG>not</NEG> enough</SCOPE> , the mystery surrounding the mother has been completely uncloaked .

She 's a legally blonde ... something , <SCOPE>I do <NEG>n't</NEG> remember ( my bad</SCOPE> ! ) and she is hosting a party at her house that night .

If <SCOPE>it 's <NEG>not</NEG> clean</SCOPE> , she will be fired , because her boss has verminophobia .

Could <SCOPE><NEG>n't</NEG> they just have gotten the house clean for the sake of having it clean ?</SCOPE>

And <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to hit below the belt or anything</SCOPE> , but they looked absolutely frightening !

<SCOPE>I do <NEG>n't</NEG> know how much Smash Mouth paid ( or got paid ) to have 1/3 of their album played behind this thing either , but it must 've been a pretty penny</SCOPE> !

<SCOPE>Acting ? Do <NEG>n't</NEG> ask</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>Do <NEG>n't</NEG> know if the same will hold true for you folks , probably not</SCOPE> !
Do n't know if the same will hold true for <SCOPE>you folks , probably <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> !

<SCOPE>Bottom line , do <NEG>n't</NEG> be a rule breaker</SCOPE> .

I 'll be the first to admit that <SCOPE>I was <NEG>never</NEG> a big fan of Dr. Seuss 's , Cat In The</SCOPE> Hat .

When Ron Howard and Brian Grazer announced that they were moving forward with a Cat In The Hat movie , I was <SCOPE><NEG>n't</NEG> expecting much</SCOPE> .

After all , The Grinch , also based upon a Dr. Seuss book , had a lot of flash , but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> much substance</SCOPE> .


I assume you 're familiar with the book so <SCOPE>I wo <NEG>n't</NEG> rehash the entire plot</SCOPE> ... The movie loosely follows the book , taking lots of modern day liberties .

<SCOPE>One day , their usual babysitter is <NEG>unable</NEG> to stay with them and Mom must find a replacement .</SCOPE>

Before returning to work , she specifically tells Conrad and Sally that <SCOPE>they are <NEG>not</NEG> to step a foot into the living room , or else</SCOPE> .

What , <SCOPE>his buddy Ron Howard was <NEG>n't</NEG> available ?</SCOPE>

Besides phoning in their performances , they seemed to have <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> real love for each other</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>He 's <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> .

Ewww ... the selections were horrible , <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to mention the fact that the tunes stuck out like sore thumbs</SCOPE> .

There were several , obvious glitches and mistakes ( <SCOPE>that should have been handled in editing but were <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> ) .


<SCOPE>Mr. Director must <NEG>not</NEG> be able to deal with animated characters</SCOPE> ...

Now <SCOPE>Kelly Preston did <NEG>n't</NEG> offend me , so I guess you can say that this was the most redeeming part of the movie .</SCOPE>

<SCOPE>Poor Buddy was abandoned to an orphanage and <NEG>never</NEG> knew his real parents</SCOPE> .

For some reason , <SCOPE>Santa <NEG>failed</NEG> to notice his presence until they arrived back at the North Pole and Buddy crawled out of the bag</SCOPE> .

He did nt seem to be a bad guy , just someone who managed to get off track in life as his main focus became <SCOPE>dollar signs and <NEG>not</NEG> being happy with his life</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>Buddy may <NEG>not</NEG> have been the perfect elf</SCOPE> , but hes picked up some amazing talents and abilities from being around them .

Theres <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> much really in the way of gross-out humor , which was something I really</SCOPE> appreciated .

The one bodily-noise humor comes after he chugs a full 2-liter of soda , but my feelings of dread that this was going to take a downturn in the humor department after this <SCOPE>were <NEG>not</NEG> founded</SCOPE> .

Hes got a child-like innocence as he wanders around the city and has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> real idea of the consequences of his actions at times</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>His expressions of wide-eyed innocence at the events going on around him are also near-perfect , and <NEG>not</NEG> exaggerated nor over-done .</SCOPE>
His expressions of wide-eyed innocence at the events going on around him are also near-perfect , and not exaggerated <SCOPE><NEG>nor</NEG> over-done</SCOPE> .

While the film raptly kept my 8-year-olds interest , <SCOPE>my 3-year-old was <NEG>not</NEG> impressed at all</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>It <NEG>failed</NEG> to capture his attention as many of the animated films do</SCOPE> , and he fell asleep in my arms near the end .

It 's also a good film if your kids still believe in Santa or are at the cusp where they are starting to have doubts , much like The Santa Clause was for my older daughter ( who opted to hang out with her friends <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> go to the theater with us - her loss</SCOPE> ) .

Im <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> a Will Ferrell fan at all</SCOPE> , but I did enjoy this movie .

<SCOPE><NEG>Not</NEG> only does the film</SCOPE> open up against The Matrix Revolutions , the yuletide feature goes head to head with the highly publicized The Cat in the Hat and Disneys The Haunted Mansion later this month .

<SCOPE>Buddy is <NEG>not</NEG> the typical elf , his large size being the biggest factor .</SCOPE>

Buddy , who <SCOPE>has <NEG>never</NEG> been to the human world</SCOPE> , is unfamiliar with many of the things we are accustomed to like revolving doors and food products that dont include sugar .

This happens mostly in part to Ferrells performance but there are also plenty of moments that come off as hilarious even <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> the lead star</SCOPE> .

Ferrell is able to make Buddy the elf both lovable and hilarious <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> pushing the personality of the character</SCOPE> too far as to make him annoying and pathetic .

<SCOPE>The only problem lied <NEG>not</NEG> with Caans performance but the character itself in how quickly the character changed his attitude at the end without really having a change-of-heart experience</SCOPE> .
The only problem lied not with Caans performance but the character itself in how quickly the character changed his attitude at the end <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> really having a change-of-heart experience</SCOPE> .

Its the wonderful atmosphere and Will Ferrells exuberant performance that makes this film a delightful treat for the whole family can enjoy <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> one member of the family</SCOPE> being alienated by certain material .

Ferrells over-the-top performance should be a decisive enough reason to venture to the local movie theater and see Elf but if <SCOPE>you are <NEG>not</NEG> truly convinced</SCOPE> , here may be a better reason : Elf will keep the children busy for an hour and a half while the parents do their Christmas shopping .

He then grows up to realize that <SCOPE>he is <NEG>not</NEG> an elf</SCOPE> , and ventures out into the real world to find his father ( James Caan ) .

He finds him , and at first <SCOPE>is <NEG>not</NEG> accepted</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>Not</NEG> really cry like big time</SCOPE> , but a tear did roll down my cheek , in more than one place .

Weird , is <SCOPE><NEG>n't</NEG> it</SCOPE> ?

This movie is a very good family <SCOPE>movie <NEG>not</NEG> just because it 's about Christmas</SCOPE> but because it has a good message to it .

I have seen this movie twice now and <SCOPE>can <NEG>never</NEG> stop laughing at Buddy 's</SCOPE> ( Will Farrel ) actions to the city .

I really enjoy how Will can make a movie <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> using adult humor</SCOPE> .

I only have one bad thing to say about this movie ... <SCOPE>I really do <NEG>n't</NEG> like the angry elf</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>My boyfriend does <NEG>n't</NEG> even like Christmas and</SCOPE> told me he had goosebumps for the last 20 minutes of the movie .

<SCOPE>That story was <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> an exceedingly long one , so as you can imagine the film has been extended quite a bit with original material in order to make it a feature length film .

But more often <SCOPE>than <NEG>not</NEG> , hes very funny , and at times hilarious</SCOPE> .

Make <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> mistake</SCOPE> , neither one is as charming as , say , McCauley Culkin in Home Alone or Uncle Buck , but they are convincing enough in their roles for the film to work .
Make no mistake , <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> one</SCOPE> is as charming as , say , McCauley Culkin in Home Alone or Uncle Buck , but they are convincing enough in their roles for the film to work .

Kelly Preston has little to <SCOPE>do and <NEG>not</NEG> much time to do it in</SCOPE> .

When we attended , the kids in the audience seemed magically enthralled , eyes fixed on the screen throughout the film and with nary a sound escaping their lips <SCOPE><NEG>except</NEG> for the frequent fits of laughter</SCOPE> .

Well , <SCOPE>I am usually <NEG>never</NEG> disappointed with Halle 's acting</SCOPE> , she is extremely good .

<SCOPE>What was <NEG>not</NEG> so great about the movie was that there were gaps in the plot .</SCOPE>

Plus , the role that Downey Jr. played was a little unclear -- <SCOPE>was he an obstacle or <NEG>not</NEG> ?</SCOPE>

<SCOPE>These questions were <NEG>not</NEG> really answered</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>The idea of the film is <NEG>not</NEG> new either</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>I 'm <NEG>not</NEG> going to give away the plot</SCOPE> .

But <SCOPE>they do <NEG>n't</NEG> last long</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>This movie is <NEG>not</NEG> too scary for the youngest of children</SCOPE> , but the plot might confuse kids under 8 or 9 . PG is a good rating for a few mild oaths .

Plot Details : This opinion reveals <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> details</SCOPE> about the movie' 's plot .

As the parent of a 5 year old who had just returned from a one week vacation at Walt Disney World , the inescapable fact was that we WERE going to see this movie ( unless it was X-rated due to full-frontal nudity , etc. ) whether <SCOPE>we adults liked it or <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>This is <NEG>not</NEG> the usual in-your-face CGI tour-de-force Hollywood product</SCOPE> .

It was a little scarier than I expected , but <SCOPE>it was <NEG>not</NEG> too scary for my 5 year old .</SCOPE>

There was some mild swearing , but nothing that <SCOPE>a kid does <NEG>n't</NEG> hear on T.V. these days</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>This movie is <NEG>not</NEG> a comedy just because it has Eddie Murphy in it</SCOPE> , and it is not a horror movie just because of the subject matter .

I 've got to admit that the first time I saw the trailer for Calendar Girls <SCOPE>I was <NEG>n't</NEG> exactly charged with anticipation</SCOPE> .

Nevertheless I recognized that <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> only did the trailer look fun</SCOPE> , but I had been pleasantly surprised by another British comedy that did n't appeal to me , Bend It Like Beckham .

Before he died he wrote a poem about his flowers , and mentioned how flowers are like Women , they get more beautiful with age ( <SCOPE>note-this does <NEG>not</NEG> necessarily reflect my own opinion )</SCOPE> .

However since <SCOPE>the women 's Institute <NEG>never</NEG> makes money off their sales Chris decides to try a different approach , and gets a few of the other members to join her in making a nude calendar</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>Crosbie and the other actresses did <NEG>n't</NEG> have to rely on just themselves though because they had the support of some good writers</SCOPE> .

It 's based on a true story , but <SCOPE>that has <NEG>n't</NEG> prevented historical inaccuracies in the past</SCOPE> , and whilst I do n't really know anything about what really happened , I do know that the film is more than just another feel good comedy .

<SCOPE>It 's <NEG>never</NEG> strong or prolonged</SCOPE> but there are a few moments of nudity in the film that will likely earn the same sort of childish comments as Cathy Bates infamous scene in About Schmidt .

However you feel about nudity in films , <SCOPE>it 's <NEG>unlikely</NEG> that many people will actually want to see this so I posted this little warning here</SCOPE> .

If <SCOPE>you do <NEG>n't</NEG> think you</SCOPE> 'll mind some mild nudity involving older ladies though , then Calendar Girls is a fun , well acted and at times emotional movie that 's worth seeing .

I found it interesting that the story was told well and it corresponded enough with the ride to have a familiar tone , but had enough originality that <SCOPE>I did <NEG>not</NEG> feel as though I was on the ride I have ridden hundreds of times before ( being a former mouse employee )</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>Not</NEG> since Dan Akroyd donned his own thread bare red and white outfit , in the movie Trading Places , has the world seen such a sad and pathetic Santa Claus as the one played by Billy Bob Thornton in the newly released motion picture Bad Santa .</SCOPE>

<SCOPE>Kris Kringle will <NEG>never</NEG> be looked at in the same way again for anyone that sees this hilarious uptake on the bearded man from the North</SCOPE> .

Snot nosed , overweight , and generally messed up in the head , Kellys scenes with Thornton bring out the humanity in a man that otherwise has <SCOPE><NEG>none</NEG></SCOPE> .

I think I got lung cancer ( I know this is <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> laughing matter ) just watching this movie</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>I had <NEG>n't</NEG> laughed that hard or that consistently at just a preview in a very very long time</SCOPE> .

For those who had the same fear as I did , you may have <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> fear</SCOPE> .

The scenes between Ritter and Mac in particular feel like <SCOPE>they were <NEG>n't</NEG> even shot at the same time with them in the same room</SCOPE> .

Completely vulgar and politically incorrect ( a few choice losers are protesting because it 's put out by a Disney subsidiary , I say to all of you : GET A LIFE ) , Bad Santa is most certainly <SCOPE><NEG>NOT</NEG> for the kiddies</SCOPE> ( as if the previews did n't already make THAT expressly clear ) .

<SCOPE>Terry Zwigoff 's `` Bad Santa `` is <NEG>not</NEG> for you</SCOPE> .

At one point , he wets his Santa pants right in front of the children , and this is actually one of his more forgivable offenses because he 's so drunk <SCOPE>he does <NEG>n't</NEG> even realize what he 's done</SCOPE> .

If you play <SCOPE>it well , some people will <NEG>not</NEG> be able to separate the actor from the character and excoriate the performer as a monster just for doing his job to the best of his ability</SCOPE> .

It is to the endless credit of Thornton , an actor who has made a career out of socially maladjusted misfits ( `` Sling Blade '' , `` A Simple Plan `` ) , that he seems to have taken to this role <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> a moment 's thought</SCOPE> about what a monster like Willie could do to his public image .

He growls the character 's endless obscenities with a phlegm-throated relish , throws himself into twisted misbehavior with heedless abandon ... and what 's most amazing of all , somehow manages , against all our better instincts , to move us with this portrayal of a hateful man by <SCOPE><NEG>never</NEG> letting us forget that he hates himself most of all</SCOPE> .

`` <SCOPE>I am <NEG>not</NEG> Santa Claus '' , he tells a little boy .</SCOPE>

`` If anything , I 'm living proof that <SCOPE>there is <NEG>n't</NEG> any Santa Claus . ``</SCOPE>

Willie is a man who has lost his capacity to believe in anything , most of all himself , and the wasted excess that is his life is <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> Dionysian revel</SCOPE> , but rather the extended suicide of a man who feels that he has more than earned all his self-inflicted suffering ( at one point , feeling that even he is being too easy on himself , Willie tries to take himself out with carbon monoxide in a garage ... all while wearing the Santa suit , of course ) .

This is a monumental comic performance , funny as hell and lived in down to the gin-soaked bones by a great actor , and the Oscar nominees are incomplete if <SCOPE>they do <NEG>not</NEG> include him ( which I have every reason to suspect they will not , as Gooding 's Rain Man of the gridiron is much more the type of up-with-people role the Oscars tend to reward )</SCOPE> .

His name is Thurman Merman ( Brett Kelly ) , and he 's a sad , overweight eight-year-old boy who latches on to Willie and <SCOPE>wo <NEG>n't</NEG> let go</SCOPE> .

Thankfully , `` Bad Santa `` manages to tell this Yuletide story of a monster 's salvation <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> resorting to the `` Will Ferrell learns the true meaning of Christmas `` cliches that have sent many a holiday audience into sugar shock over the years</SCOPE> .

Director Zwigoff 's past films , including the remarkable documentary `` Crumb `` and the dark but surprisingly sweet `` Ghost World `` , have evinced a soft spot for the disenfranchised and misunderstood souls of the world , and the miracle of those films is that he allows us to see and embrace the humanity of these creatures <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> soft-pedaling the weirdness and nihilism that has made them</SCOPE> outsiders to begin with .

Kelly , likewise , <SCOPE>is <NEG>not</NEG> your typical cookie-cutter cute movie kid</SCOPE> .

But when Willie is dumbstruck by Thurman 's simple sweet Christmas gift of a wooden pickle , when Thurman announces that <SCOPE>Santa has <NEG>n't</NEG> brought him a Christmas present for the last two years `` because I know I 'm just a dips -- t loser `` ... you ca n't help but root for these guys</SCOPE> .

Maybe <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to become president , but at least for Thurman to get the pink stuffed elephant he so dearly wants for Christmas .</SCOPE>

That Zwigoff manages to move us with these characters , all the while causing us <SCOPE>to laugh in disbelief at the extremity of Willie 's awfulness and the film 's <NEG>lack</NEG> of faith in the standard Hollywood-Christmas quick fix</SCOPE> , is a great testament to both the director 's delicate touch and to the skilled work of writers John Requa and Glenn Ficarra , who also scripted the darker-and-funnier-than-expected `` Cats and Dogs `` ( the script went through several uncredited rewrites , including one by executive producers Joel and Ethan Coen and one by Zwigoff himself ) .


And , amazingly enough , it still manages to carry a potent message about how <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> person</SCOPE> is beyond salvation if he can find it within his pickled , diabolical soul to commit one act that is for the good of the world and others .

`` Bad Santa `` reminds us of a message that is always useful to hear : <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> one</SCOPE> , even the most loathsome of us all , is completely without value .

Billy-bob is so unredeemable and disgusting that <SCOPE>you ca <NEG>n't</NEG> help</SCOPE> , but laugh when brat after brat climbs aboard his tipsy lap and lists their demands .

That in itself <SCOPE>would <NEG>n't</NEG> be so bad</SCOPE> , but eventually Marcus and his horrible girlfriend kill the security guard and during their annual robbery , double-cross Billy-bob .

By this point , <SCOPE>Billy-bob has <NEG>not</NEG> exactly reformed his ways , but now , at least cares enough about the fat loser kid to want to get him a gift ( a pink elephant )</SCOPE> .

The focus group ending bothered me ; it felt <SCOPE>a little bit like the writer did <NEG>n't</NEG> know how to end it</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>I was <NEG>n't</NEG></SCOPE> a huge fan of the dark turn it took , but I did n't think it hurt the film as much as the happy ending .
I was n't <SCOPE>a huge fan of the dark turn it took , but I did <NEG>n't</NEG> think it hurt the film as much as the happy ending</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>This is <NEG>not</NEG> the type of film I normally enjoy seeing in the theater , by the way .</SCOPE>

<SCOPE>The Knapely chapter of the Women 's Institute ( W.I. ) is <NEG>n't</NEG> very interesting .</SCOPE>

A few conflicts were developed that <SCOPE><NEG>never</NEG> found any resolution in the film</SCOPE> .

Of course , there is <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> absolute necessity to wrap everything up neatly by the end of an hour and a half</SCOPE> , but it is nice to see at least the beginnings of a resolution on most of the issues .


That said , <SCOPE>it does <NEG>n't</NEG> by any means ruin the film</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>The few flaws <NEG>hardly</NEG> detract from the general sense of enjoyment engendered by the movie</SCOPE> .

Even if this kind of film is <SCOPE><NEG>n't</NEG> your cup of tea</SCOPE> , think about renting it when it hits your local video store .

The film is based on the real-life events from a Yorkshire village a few years ago , although the Director was keen on maintaining that <SCOPE>the individual characters in the film are <NEG>not</NEG> themselves based on the real-life women</SCOPE> .

Whilst most of the group are initially reluctant , the fifty-something middle-class folk are gradually talked round into stripping off ( nude , <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> naked</SCOPE> , Annie is keen to point out ) , with their biblical parts ( or front bottoms  if you like ) carefully concealed behind implements traditionally associated with the WI .

However , <SCOPE><NEG>none</NEG> of them</SCOPE> could imagine the impact that the calendar would have over the coming weeks , as it transcends them to superstar status way beyond their village .

The northerness and nudity inevitably leads it to be compared to The Full Monty , but its quirks differentiate it from its predecessor and <SCOPE>there does <NEG>not</NEG> appear to be an intention to mimic</SCOPE> .

Mirren and Walters , surely two of the most talented British actresses of their generation , give great performances and bounce off each other beautifully , easily switching from comedy to drama when required <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> being hammy</SCOPE> and trying too hard .

John ( played perfectly by Alderton ) is always optimistic and upbeat during his illness , and the scenes with Anne are warm and <SCOPE>touching <NEG>rather than</NEG> melancholy and melodramatic</SCOPE> .

Complementing each other <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> any one person trying to dominate the screen</SCOPE> , the marvellous cast match the playful script .

A good old-fashioned straightforward plot with the emphasis on script and characters <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> having a deep philosophical meaning</SCOPE> , it is fantastically watchable and jam-packed with witty one-liners and should appeal to a wide ranging audience .

<SCOPE>I still have <NEG>n't</NEG> forgiven Tom for what he did to Nicole</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>I do <NEG>n't</NEG> think that he 's a particularly gifted actor however , like Britney Spears</SCOPE> , he is the consummate entertainer .

Their own people , specifically those who <SCOPE>do <NEG>not</NEG> wish to see the modern ways</SCOPE> take over their world .

Unfortunately , <SCOPE>the government does <NEG>n't</NEG> want to hear that and despite Algren 's proof , they send a group in to hold the samurais back from disturbing a railroad</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>Well relax , I did <NEG>n't</NEG></SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>Even the hap-hazard beard and scruff could <NEG>n't</NEG> hide his pretty-boy face and that my friends , was distracting</SCOPE> .

He had a screen presence that <SCOPE>I have <NEG>n't</NEG> seen in a long time</SCOPE> .

His charisma ( magnetic , charming , forceful , and mysterious ) is what pushed me to recommend this movie and I really wish that the entire story would have focused around him and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> Tom</SCOPE> .

I felt cheated that there was a <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of emotional bonding</SCOPE> between the characters .

I mean , there was some between Algren and <SCOPE>Katsumoto ( but <NEG>not</NEG> nearly enough )</SCOPE> and virtually nothing but superficial ties with the rest of the characters .

Although I 'm thrilled that <SCOPE>they did <NEG>n't</NEG> have Tom doin ' everybody</SCOPE> , I felt a little cheated about his interactions with the opposite sex .

In addition , for a movie that <SCOPE>did <NEG>n't</NEG> have enough emotional bonding</SCOPE> , it relied a lot on melodrama to manipulate the audience .

Girls , if you strongly dislike blood and guts please know that while there is lots of blood shed , <SCOPE>most of the scenes were <NEG>not</NEG> horribly gross</SCOPE> .

As far as the story goes , <SCOPE>I ca <NEG>n't</NEG> vouch to any of the historical accuracies of it so if you are one of those sticklers for factual accounts</SCOPE> , you might want to do your research before you go .

<SCOPE>The main problem with The Last Samurai is <NEG>not</NEG> that the plot is almost exactly the same as both Dances with Wolves  and Shogun , but that it assumes you ve seen both those movies</SCOPE> , and cant seem to decide whether or not it thinks you want to see them again .

Its left to you then to either be able to get something <SCOPE>out of that line or <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>Were <NEG>not</NEG> across the line into something like alternate-reality sci-fi , but were approaching it .</SCOPE>

All that said , there are only two things keeping this movie from being <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> only five stars</SCOPE> , but also an instant classic ; it s ending ( and I mean the entire last thirty minutes ) , and its absolute lack of daring .
All that said , there are only two things keeping this movie from being not only five stars , but also an instant classic ; it s ending ( and I mean the entire last thirty minutes ) , and its absolute <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of daring</SCOPE> .

Instead of daring , I might actually say its <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of honor ( to itself )</SCOPE> , but that is a jaunt toward irony I choose to avoid .

<SCOPE>Ive <NEG>never</NEG> been a Cruise fan</SCOPE> , and even now he feels like an odd choice for the role to me , but he manages it far better than Id have predicted he could .

Thats <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to say hes perfect</SCOPE> .

Theres still quite a bit of the Hollywood star coming through in his performance , but <SCOPE>hes <NEG>not</NEG> horrible , and</SCOPE> certainly delivers something at least more watchable than his norm .

There are a few brilliantly crafted scenes in which Katsumoto is in the background , off-center , and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> exactly doing</SCOPE> anything .

<SCOPE><NEG>Not</NEG> so here</SCOPE> .

Panoramic views of rolling plains and hills , sunrises with a hint of cloud cover , <SCOPE>and sweeping shots of virgin forest , are <NEG>not</NEG> exactly on the cover of  Whats New and Exciting in Beautiful Pictures Monthly .</SCOPE>

<SCOPE>Its gorgeous , sure , but it s <NEG>not</NEG> exactly doing anything</SCOPE> .

It has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> real daring to it</SCOPE> , even though the first half will lead you to expect some .

Its stagy , and manages to avoid being described as formulaic only based on the uninteresting technicality that <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> ones</SCOPE> used the formula before .

Still , Im probably giving a <SCOPE>very <NEG>negative</NEG> impression of everything</SCOPE> to do with this movie that I give four stars ( out of five ) .

Ive always been easy on movies that try to do <SCOPE>something excellent and <NEG>fail</NEG> , and Im not of a mind to change that</SCOPE> now .
Ive always been easy on movies that try to do something excellent and fail , and <SCOPE>Im <NEG>not</NEG> of a mind to change that now</SCOPE> .

I should qualify that , because the question <SCOPE>of whether or <NEG>not</NEG> the creators were actually trying to do something excellent ( as opposed to something that would win awards ) is open to debate , and frankly , Im not sure which side Im on</SCOPE> .

OK , <SCOPE>I 'm <NEG>not</NEG> going to lie to you here</SCOPE> .

I 'd heard the hype , <SCOPE>I 'm <NEG>not</NEG> opposed to Tim Cruise in general ( even if I did waste seven dollars seeing Vanilla Sky in theaters )</SCOPE> , and I went under the impression that after the travesty I 'd just seen in Bad Boys II , anything out there would probably be look like Citizen Kane in comparison .

Mind you , <SCOPE>this should <NEG>n't</NEG> be all that hard , as the military is using guns , while the opposing force of Samuria warriors is using bows , arrows and swords</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>Without</NEG> revealing any more about the movie</SCOPE> , I 'll just note that I was mildly dissatisfied with the Hollywood ending to the movie .

Speaking of Cruise , when <SCOPE>he decide <NEG>not</NEG> to suck</SCOPE> ?

Cruise seemed to immerse himself in the role like <SCOPE>I ca <NEG>n't</NEG> remember him ever doing before</SCOPE> .

Regardless , <SCOPE>I would <NEG>n't</NEG> be far off if I said this is one of the his greatest performances</SCOPE> .

The rest of the cast is phenomenal , <SCOPE>but <NEG>none</NEG> greater than Ken Watanabe</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE><NEG>Never</NEG> slow and never boring , director Edward Zwick manages to find that rare balance between action and drama that all directors strive for , but rarely attain .</SCOPE>
Never slow <SCOPE>and <NEG>never</NEG> boring , director Edward Zwick manages to find that rare balance between action and drama that all directors strive for , but rarely attain .</SCOPE>

The movie is respectful enough of its subject matter <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to put all the glory around its central character</SCOPE> and that is what helps this movie to shine .

Cruise is a fine lead actor , <SCOPE><NEG>never</NEG> stealing the spotlight</SCOPE> , but always commanding enough presence for us to believe the film .

It works perfectly for the film , because this is a character drama and a war epic , <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> a story-driven film</SCOPE> .

There is <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> need for an overly complex plot</SCOPE> , because what were expected to be drawn to here is these people and why theyre so willing to fight for what they believe in .

<SCOPE>It may <NEG>not</NEG> be wholly original at all</SCOPE> , but it works .

<SCOPE>These are <NEG>not</NEG> savage warriors as the early goings of the film</SCOPE> would have us believe , but they are families , fathers fighting to give their children some tradition to cherish .

Its <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> simply all out war</SCOPE> , but it s stylistic in its approach as well .

It is perfectly shot and perfectly directed to an emotional resonance <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> often found outside something like Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings</SCOPE> .

Cruise trains fiercely with the town warriors , refusing to stop until <SCOPE>he can <NEG>no</NEG> longer move</SCOPE> , and earning the respect of the villagers .

In short , he realizes that <SCOPE>these people are <NEG>not</NEG> the bad guys</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>I will <NEG>not</NEG> rest until I get the word out this is one of the best movies out for 2003</SCOPE> !

<SCOPE>It is <NEG>not</NEG> quite perfect , but is the only film I 've seen since X2 that succeeds on almost every level it set out to attain .</SCOPE>

As <SCOPE>I 'm <NEG>not</NEG> the first review here</SCOPE> , everyone should know the story by now .

He gets hired to train a new `` western `` style army for the Emperor of Japan , but gets captured after a <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG></SCOPE> first attempt at defeating the Samurai rebellion .

I forced my reluctant wife ( who had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> interest</SCOPE> ) to see it , and she left the theatre happily surprised .

For me who had such high expectations <SCOPE>this did <NEG>not</NEG> disappoint</SCOPE> .


The director has said upfront they tried to be extremely accurate on all things for that era , but <SCOPE>the story is <NEG>not</NEG> a true one .</SCOPE>

Yes it does have its predictable moments , but for <SCOPE>me this did <NEG>not</NEG> distract from enjoying an epic tale</SCOPE> .

Although we see Cruise 's on all the promotional material , <SCOPE>his is <NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE> the best you 've seen yet .

Acting wise , <SCOPE>Cruise stays on top of his game , <NEG>no</NEG> I do n't think it</SCOPE> is `` Oscar-worthy `` despite the amount of training he did for the role , but he really has n't been better .

How can <SCOPE>I <NEG>not</NEG> be blow away from the intense battle scenes</SCOPE> !

<SCOPE><NEG>Never</NEG> have you seen the Samurai sword wielded with such amazing skill ... by everyone in this film .</SCOPE>

Last but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> least I should n't forget to mention the gorgeous cinematagraphy and score .</SCOPE>
Last but not <SCOPE>least I should <NEG>n't</NEG> forget to mention the gorgeous cinematagraphy and score</SCOPE> .

<SCOPE>The writers did <NEG>n't</NEG> know how to properly close it so they stamped it with the all too typical `` hollywood hero `` end</SCOPE> .

How ridiculous is it every Samurai gets killed on the battlefield <SCOPE><NEG>except</NEG> Algren , especially when they let loose the heavy artillery on the charging Samurai</SCOPE> .

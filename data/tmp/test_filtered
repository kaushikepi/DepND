I would have liked it if this camera had aperture control.

If human being were not killing one another, we could live a happier life.

I wish it were true.

I wish she were here.

If I were you, I would run.

If I saw you, I would be happy.

If I cooked dinner, no one would eat it.

If I had been you, I would have run.

If I had seen you, I would have been happy.

If I had cooked dinner, no one would have eaten it.

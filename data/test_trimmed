PMA treatment, and not retinoic acid treatment of the U937 cells acts in inducing NF-KB expression in the nuclei.

When U937 cells were infected with HIV-1, no induction of NF-KB factor was detected, whereas high level of progeny virions was produced, suggesting that this factor was not required for viral replication.

Positive and negative regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression by a novel B-cell-specific enhancer element.

Tandem copies of this 67-bp MnlI-AluI fragment, when fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene driven by the conalbumin promoter, stimulated transcription in B cells but not in Jurkat T cells or HeLa cells.

In agreement with the results of gel retardation assays, tandem copies of the E6 motif stimulated transcription in ARH77 and Raji cells but not in Jurkat or HeLa cells.

In striking contrast to the mouse Ig heavy-chain enhancer, in which the octamer motif acts as a B-cell-specific enhancer element, the human enhancer contains an octamerlike sequence with one base substitution which bound octamer-binding proteins with only very low affinity and showed no enhancer activity of its own.

Moreover, simian virus 40 enhancer activity was blocked by the MnlI-AluI fragment in HeLa cells but not in B cells.

Thus, the novel enhancer element identified in this study is probably a target site for both positive and negative factors.

The rate of LTR-directed gene expression increased in response to treatment with either a phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha if either the NFAT-1 or NF kappa B binding sites were deleted, but failed to respond to these mitogenic stimuli if both sequences were absent.

Neither deletion of NF kappa B nor deletion of NFAT-1 decreased activation of viral replication by phorbol ester.

Employing the EBV-transformed human B cell line SKW6.4, we demonstrate that platelet-activating factor significantly alters membrane phospholipid metabolism indicated by the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid but not significantly into phosphatidylethanolamine at concentrations ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M.

The inactive precursor, lyso-platelet-activating factor, at a concentration as high as 10(-7) M had no effect on any of the membrane phospholipids.

Receptor transcripts were 4.6 kilobases (kb), and no variant sizes were observed.

Levels of RNA coding for the receptor were not modulated by exposure to high levels of ligand.

Steady-state levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA were not affected by terminal differentiation of HL-60 toward either granulocytes or macrophages.

In contrast, nondividing peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals did not express 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA;

The Thy-1 gene promoter resembles a " housekeeping " promoter in that it is located within a methylation-free island, lacks a canonical TATA box, and displays heterogeneity in the 5'-end termini of the mRNA.

Using transgenic mice, we show that this promoter does not confer any tissue specificity and is active only in a position-dependent manner.

However, these genes are not constitutively active in B lymphocytes, suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms must play a role in determining the patterns of expression.

No group differences in cortisol levels were observed, nor were glucocorticoid receptor number and cortisol levels correlated.

The present data, along with other findings of HPA abnormalities in PTSD, support the possibility of a greater negative feedback sensitivity at one or more levels of the HPA axis.

Using recombinant HBxAg protein, we found HBxAg-specific stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection (6 of 6) and chronic hepatitis B virus infection (6 of 17) but not in healthy individuals.

Five T-cell clones specific for a T-cell epitope located at the carboxyterminal region of HBxAg were established and found to belong to the CD2/CD4-positive, CD8-negative subtype.

Except for a 4-hour advancement of the peak, a similar circadian rhythm of hepatic GR was detected in rats reared under a reversed lighting regimen (12D : 12L; lights on between 18:30 and 06:30 h).

In patients suffering from Cushing 's syndrome, the circadian rhythm of plasma cortisol either disappeared or was inverted while that of GR did not significantly deviate from the normal subjects.

In lymphocytes activated either by PHA or OKT3 ( but not in resting cells), a 50-kDa species cross-reacting with a monoclonal antibody against the intestinal vitamin D receptor was detected.

Two splice alternatives were identified that were not previously observed in human TCF-1.

These studies have been extended to show that ( i ) a mutant EBV strain lacking the gene encoding EBNA 2 fails to switch from Wp to Cp usage in primary B lymphocytes, although the virus contains a functional Cp; ( ii ) a region from -429 to -245 base pairs upstream of Cp is essential for Cp activity in B lymphocytes, but only in the context of upstream and downstream sequences; ( iii ) this region contains an EBNA 2-dependent enhancer; and ( iv ) DNase I protection employing nuclear extracts from B and T lymphocytes revealed a B-cell-specific footprint in the region of the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer.

These findings indicate that corticosteroid resistance in bronchial asthma can not be explained by abnormalities in corticosteroid receptor characteristics.

The induction of AP1 by okadaic acid suggests that protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A) may be involved in T cell activation as important negative regulators of the transcription factor AP1.

In each cohort there was only one case with a negative reaction of the primary tumor and a positive reaction with the isolated tumor cells from the pleural effusions.

Oct-2 mRNA levels and both Oct-2 and NF-kappa B proteins in nuclear extracts were not altered by treatment with TGF-beta.

In contrast, levels of the transcriptional factor AP-1, which is not known to be important in B cell Ig production, were reduced by TGF-beta.

The mechanism by which TGF-beta inhibits Ig chain synthesis is unclear although it does not involve inhibition of the binding of NF-kappa B or Oct-2 to their respective target sequences.

This study examines the regions of the HIV promoter required for HHV-6 transactivation in a heterogeneous population of primary human T lymphocytes with or without antigenic stimulation.

However, this mutated NF kappa B promoter was not transactivated during HHV-6 ( GS ) infection or after cotransfection with pZVB70 or pZVB10.

The other gene, designated Rhom-3, is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the LIM domain of rhombotin.

Preincubation of cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 had no effect on the time course of IL-1 beta mRNA appearance in response to LPS.

However, exposure of U-937 cells to 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased by 200 % the level of IL-1 beta mRNA detected and decreased by three orders of magnitude the concentration of LPS required to achieve steady state mRNA levels equivalent to those observed in U-937 cells not preincubated with the hormone.2+o

It has been shown recently that in wild-type CEM cells but not in a dex-resistant, glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) -defective clone ICR-27 TK-3, dex induces GR mRNA.

Lavage T-lymphocytes from patients with tuberculosis or with sarcoidosis, but not those from normal control subjects, expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors as demonstrated by binding of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3, which was inhibited by the presence of excess unlabeled 1,25(OH)2D3, but not by the presence of unlabeled 25(OH)D3 (receptor-positive lymphocytes: sarcoidosis, 20 ± 12%; tuberculosis, 31 ± 17%).

In contrast, blood lymphocytes from patients with granulomatous diseases did not express detectable 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors.

Inhibition of transcription factors belonging to the rel/NF-kappa B family by a transdominant negative mutant.

A mutant of KBF1/p50 ( delta SP ), unable to bind to DNA but able to form homo- or heterodimers, has been constructed.

This mutant also functions in vivo as a trans-acting dominant negative regulator:

An iron-responsive element (IRE) motif has been identified in the 5'-untranslated region of the human erythroid ALAS mRNA, but is not present in the housekeeping ALAS mRNA.

A transcript of the ALAS IRE, mutated in the conserved loop of the IRE, did not readily form this protein-RNA complex.

Although three sites in the TNF-alpha promoter (kappa 1, kappa 2, and kappa 3) specifically bind the transcription factor NF-kappa B in lymphoid nuclear extracts, TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA does not correlate with NF-kappa B binding activities displayed by different T and B cell lines.

Therefore, TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA, like its induction by virus and LPS, is not primarily mediated by NF-kappa B, but rather is mediated through other sequences and protein factors.

Surprisingly, multimers of kappa 1-kappa 3 can confer PMA inducibility on a heterologous promoter in a B (Raji), but not a T (HUT78) cell line.

However they are not functional on a truncated TNF-alpha promoter, indicating that promoter context and cell type specificity influence the PMA inducible function of these NF-kappa B binding sites.

The HB24 mRNA was absent or present at low levels in normal B and T lymphocytes;

The proband had no detectable DPD activity.

In vitro translated MAD-3 protein was found to specifically inhibit the DNA-binding activity of the p50/p65 NF-kappa B complex but not that of the p50/p50 KBF1 factor or of other DNA-binding proteins.

Starting with a replication-incompetent molecular clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, lacking all the NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites present in the native long terminal repeat (LTR), proviruses containing reconstructed LTRs with individual or combinations of NF-kappa B and Sp1 elements were generated and evaluated for their capacity to produce virus progeny following transfection-cocultivation.

For example, in experiments involving proviral clones with LTRs containing one or two NF-kappa B elements ( and no Sp1 binding sites ), a hierarchy of cellular permissivity to virus replication (peripheral blood lymphocytes = MT4 greater than H9 greater than CEM greater than Jurkat) was observed.

However, inhibition of HIV-1 replication appears not to be directly correlated with GSH levels.

We studied glucocorticosteroid receptor density and affinity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the glucocorticosteroid binding assay in 33 patients with SLE who had taken no glucocorticosteroid for the previous 6 months and in 32 healthy controls.

The binding affinity was not different between patients and controls.

There was no correlation between glucocorticosteroid receptor number and SLE disease activity.

The results were compared with those of 12 menopausal women without diabetes and 12 normal women of childbearing age.

There was no difference in glucocorticoid receptor number or affinity between depressed patients and recovered or control subjects.

Afternoon ACTH and cortisol concentrations did not differ significantly between the three groups.

No relationship could be established between glucocorticoid receptor binding and antidepressant medication.

These data support the view of an impaired ligand-induced plasticity of glucocorticoid receptor regulation rather than the hypothesis of decreased glucocorticoid receptor numbers during depression.

Binding of the drug inhibits isomerase activity, but studies with other prolyl isomerase inhibitors and analysis of cyclosporin-resistant mutants in yeast suggest that the effects of the drug result from the formation of an inhibitory complex between the drug and isomerase, and not from inhibition of isomerase activity.

A transcription factor, NF-AT, which is essential for early T-cell gene activation, seems to be a specific target of cyclosporin A and FK506 action because transcription directed by this protein is blocked in T cells treated with these drugs, with little or no effect on other transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-kappa B.

FK506 and cyclosporin A block translocation of the cytoplasmic component without affecting synthesis of the nuclear subunit.

Furthermore, activation of PKC was pertussis-toxin-sensitive and was associated with the detection of an NF kappa B protein in nuclear extracts of M-CSF-induced blood monocytes but not in monocytes exposed to medium treatment only.

Phorbol activation was positively modulated by Ca2+ influx while TNF alpha activation was not.

TNF alpha did not activate cAMP production and its signal was not modulated by cAMP activators.

Moreover, cAMP activators did not activate NF-kappa B in Jurkat cells.

Thus, TNF alpha-induced NF-kappa B activation was found to be mediated by none of the major signal-mediating kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A, or Ca(2+)-regulated kinases.

Furthermore, we found that cytoplasmic acidification facilitated NF-kappa B activation by both TNF alpha and PKC, by a mechanism that increases NF-kappa B/I kappa B dissociation without affecting the NF-kappa B translocation step.

Glucocorticoid receptors (GcR) were determined by a whole cell assay in human mononulear leukocytes (hMNL) from control subjects, patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for systemic diseases and Cushing 's disease patients with or without ketoconazole therapy.

In this group, however, receptor levels and morning plasma cortisol values showed a negative correlation, indicating a subtle down-regulatory effect.

Finally, we did not observed either up-regulation or antagonism of GcR by ketoconazole treatment, at the time that cortisol levels of patients with Cushing 's disease were reduced.

This indicates that the beneficial effects of ketoconazole in Cushing 's disease are due to adrenal cortisol suppression and not to interaction with GcR of target cells, and that the process of GcR regulation in hMNL is a complex phenomenon awaiting further elucidation.

the number of glucocorticoid receptors per cell (Ro) and the binding affinity (Kd) for dexamethasone were , however, not significantly different (Ro: 7687 ± 1750 vs 7347 ± 1285 sites/cell; Kd: 7.7 ± 2.4 vs 7.4 ± 1.7 nM at 24 degrees C).

After weight gain (14 ± 2 to 16 ± 2 kg/m2), receptor numbers were 8421 ± 2126 (pre) and 9011 ± 500 (post) sites/cell, which are not significantly different (P greater than 0.2);

CONCLUSIONS Hypercortisolaemia does not down-regulate the lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptors in anorexia nervosa and a post-receptor defect might be involved in peripheral tissue resistance to the effects of glucocorticoid hormones in undernutrition.

Although absent in nonexpressing erythroleukemia cell lines, the DNase I site is present in uninduced myelomonocytic cell lines and is not changed after PMA induction.

This decrease was seen in patients who responded to the therapy as well as in those who did not.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the B2 factor is expressed in the cytosol of monocytes and macrophages as a DNA-binding protein, indicating that it is not associated with an inhibitor (IKB).

Furthermore, an antiserum against KBF1 (identical to 50 kDa NF-kappa B protein) reacted with the p50 of NF-GM2, indicating that the NF-GM2 polypeptide can not be immunologically differentiated from the 50 kDa subunit of NF-kappa B.

The purified NF-GM2 activated in vitro transcription from the kappa B enhancer, while it failed to stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter harboring the GM2 sequence.

there was no apparent seasonal variation in GR.

Gender difference in the number of GR was not significant, although women showed slightly fewer GR.

However, in normal subjects, the GR in MNL did not demonstrate circadian variation, in contrast to concentrations of plasma cortisol.

All factors are induced in the nuclei of T cells upon activation with mitogens but not with exogenous IL-2 growth factor.

The larger crossreacting protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of 80 kDa, was localized in the cell cytosol, and appeared to be specific for activated lymphocytes since it was not detected in several other human cells including monocytes.

From information available in the literature on the substrate specificity of the three enzymes, it is clear that a cysteine is not accepted in any of the S2, S1, S1', and S2' subsites of cathepsin B and L, and not in the S1 and S1' subsites of cathepsin D.

We have conducted functional studies of the enhancer elements of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) using the human T-cell lines Jurkat and MOLT 4, which are negative for HTLV-I, and MT-2 and TL-Mor, which carry the proviral genome of HTLV-I.

However, the C26 element alone, even when repeated, could not be activated by p40tax, unlike other NF-kappa B-binding elements.

The finding that dexamethasone has no effect on TPA-induced activation of PKC suggests that this glucocorticoid inhibits signals downstream or parallel to this enzyme.

Nuclear run-on assays demonstrate that : ( 1 ) induction of c-jun and c-fos expression by TPA is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms, ( 2 ) TPA-induced expression of c-jun and c-fos does not require protein synthesis, and ( 3 ) TPA-induced expression of both genes is inhibited at the transcriptional level by dexamethasone.

Charybdotoxin-sensitive, Ca(2+)-dependent membrane potential changes are not involved in human T or B cell activation and proliferation.

We demonstrate that charybdotoxin inhibits the ligand-induced transient membrane hyperpolarization in B and T cells in a dose-dependent fashion, without affecting changes in cytosolic Ca2+.

However, blockade of the Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel is not associated with changes in cell-cycle gene activation, IL-2 production, IL-2R expression or B and T cell mitogenesis.

These results imply that membrane potential changes secondary to the ligand-dependent opening of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels are not involved in B and T lymphocyte activation and mitogenesis.

In vitro translated hGR was capable of selective DNA binding even in the absence of glucocorticoid.

Treatment with dexamethasone or the antiglucocorticoid RU486 had no additional effect on the DNA-binding capacity when receptor preparations were maintained at 0 C (no activation).

Oligonucleotides containing the consensus GRE were the most efficient competitors, and fragments containing regulatory sequences from glucocorticoid-repressible genes were somewhat competitive, whereas single stranded oligonucleotides were unable to compete for mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat DNA binding, except when competitor was present at extremely high concentrations.

Similarities between the effects of dexamethasone and RU486 suggest that the antiglucocorticoid properties of RU486 do not occur at the level of specific DNA binding.

When cloned in multiple copies this so-called TCEd (distal T cell element) acts as an inducible proto-enhancer element in E14 T lymphoma cells, but not in HeLa cells.

Negative regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression in monocytes: role of the 65-kDa plus 50-kDa NF-kappa B dimer.

These differences in gene expression have not been molecularly defined.

In THP-1 cells with restricted HIV expression, there is an absence of DNA-protein binding complex formation with the HIV-1 promoter-enhancer associated with markedly less viral RNA production.

This absence of binding was localized to the NF-kappa B region of the HIV-1 enhancer;

Adding purified NF-kappa B protein to nuclear extracts from cells with restricted expression overcomes this lack of binding.

Antiserum specific for NF-kappa B binding proteins, but not c-rel-specific antiserum, disrupted heterodimer complex formation.

We have determined that the developmental control of immunoglobulin kappa 3' enhancer ( kappa E3' ) activity is the result of the combined influence of positive- and negative-acting elements.

We show that a central core in the kappa E3' enhancer is active at the pre-B-cell stage but is repressed by flanking negative-acting elements.

The negative-acting sequences repress enhancer activity in a position- and orientation-independent manner at the pre-B-cell stage.

We have isolated a human cDNA clone encoding a zinc finger protein (NF-E1) that binds to the negative-acting segment of the kappa E3' enhancer.

Except for the conserved zinc-finger domains, the amino acid sequences of the three proteins are distinct.

In contrast mRNA representing pAT 591/EGR2 was not expressed in these cells.

cAMP-dependent regulation of proenkephalin by JunD and JunB: positive and negative effects of AP-1 proteins.

As a homodimer JunB is unable to bind the enhancer; however in the presence of c-Fos, high-affinity binding is observed.

The resistant patients showed no significant improvements in airflow limitation.

Phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -induced proliferation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes from the sensitive but not the resistant asthmatic patients was significantly (p less than 0.01) inhibited by dexamethasone (10(-7) mol/L), reflecting a shift of the dose-response curve.

No differences were observed between six of the sensitive and resistant patients in the clearance of plasma prednisolone derived from orally administered prednisone.

The numbers and binding affinities of these receptors could not account for the observed difference in the susceptibility of these cells to functional inhibition by dexamethasone in vitro.

These results suggest that clinical glucocorticoid resistance in chronic asthma does not reflect abnormal glucocorticoid clearance but may be due at least partly to a relative insensitivity of T lymphocytes to glucocorticoids.

This lack of sensitivity is unexplained but is not attributable to abnormalities of cellular glucocorticoid receptors.

Thus these data suggest that the phorbol myristate-induced signal (prolonged protein kinase C activation?) can not be inhibited by prior incubation with dexamethasone and it also protects the induced mRNA for the degradative action of dexamethasone.

Identification of transcriptional suppressor proteins that bind to the negative regulatory element of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1.

Two different proteins which independently bound to neighboring sequences within the negative regulatory element (NRE) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were detected in the nuclear extract of a virus-infected human T cell line.

However, this factor did not bind to a typical AP-1 site.

Thus, each factor may function as a novel negative regulator of transcription.

We have shown that the Z gene product, which binds to AP-1 sites as a homodimer and has sequence similarity to c-Fos, can efficiently activate the EBV early promoter, BMRF1, in certain cell types (i.e. , HeLa cells) but not others (i.e. , Jurkat cells).

Synergistic transactivation of the BMRF1 promoter by the Z/c-myb combination appears to involve direct binding by the Z protein but not the c-myb protein.

A dimerization cofactor of HNF-1 alpha (DCoH) was identified that displayed a restricted tissue distribution and did not bind to DNA, but , rather, selectively stabilized HNF-1 alpha dimers.

The formation of a stable tetrameric DCoH-HNF-1 alpha complex, which required the dimerization domain of HNF-1 alpha, did not change the DNA binding characteristics of HNF-1 alpha, but enhanced its transcriptional activity.

However, DCoH did not confer transcriptional activation to the GAL4 DNA binding domain.

The findings are the first to demonstrate membrane binding sites with a high affinity for aldosterone, but not for cortisol.

The second male patient had slight hypertension without hypokalemia.

There was a normal increase in ACTH, cortisol, and GH (except in one obese patient) in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, while cortisol production was elevated in three patients.

In the second male patient, no abnormalities were found.

In contrast, mild oxidation with glucose oxidase selectively inhibits p75 and p85 binding while not blocking p50 and p55 interactions.

In vitro-translated proteins, truncated downstream of the Rel domain and excluding the repeats, bind kappa B sites.

LDP not only increases plasma estradiol levels, but also increases the leucocytic ER levels.

This method could be quite useful to detect not only CAG repeats in SBMA but also other polymorphic dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats.

These findings show that nuclear NF-kappa B is necessary to activate the kappa B enhancer, while KBF1 by itself is not sufficient.

Estrogen receptor positive (ER+: MCF-7) and negative (ER-: MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cell lines were utilized to evaluate the effects of tamoxifen (TAM) and estradiol (E2) on modulation of breast cancer target susceptibility to lysis by lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells.

E2-stimulated ER+ cells were more susceptible to lysis by LAK cells than corresponding TAM-treated or control cells, while treatment of ER- cells with either E2 or TAM alone did not alter from control their susceptibility to this immune-mediated lysis.

Deletions upstream of the PRDII element increased transcription in the uninduced extract, indicating predominantly negative regulation of the promoter.

Small apolar substitutions (11 alpha-methyl, 11 alpha-fluoromethyl) did not markedly decrease the affinity for the vitamin D receptor, but larger (11 alpha-chloromethyl or 11 alpha- or 11 beta-phenyl) or more polar substitutions (11 alpha-hydroxymethyl, 11 alpha-(2-hydroxyethyl] decreased the affinity to less than 5% of that of 1 alpha,25-OH)2D3.

The regulation of gene expression during lymphocyte differentiation is a complex process involving interactions between multiple positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements.

This study concerns 9 iv drug abusers with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who developed hypercortisolism without the clinical signs or metabolic consequences of hypercortisolism.

Glucocorticoid receptor density was increased in AIDS patients with an Addisonian picture (group 1; 16.2 ± 9.4 fmol/million cells) compared to values in 12 AIDS patients without an Addisonian picture (group 2; 6.05 ± 2.6 fmol/million cells; P less than 0.01) and sex- and age-matched controls (3.15 ± 2.3 fmol/million cells; P less than 0.01).

Mutations affecting the 5' guanine residues of the kappa B site were unable to compete for these NF-kappa B-related proteins.

The AP-1 site at -150 bp, but not the NF-kappa B site, is likely to represent the major target of protein kinase C in the interleukin 2 promoter.

We show that induction of a trimer of the NFAT and Oct sites is not sensitive to phorbol ester treatment, and that mutations in the NF-kappa B site have no effect on inducibility of the IL-2 promoter.

Our results indicate that the AP-1 site at -150 bp represents a major, if not the only, site of PKC responsiveness in the IL-2 promoter.

The addition of antisense oligonucleotides to c-fos significantly inhibited IL 6-induced IgM production by SKW 6.4 cells (p less than 0.001), whereas control oligonucleotides had no inhibitory effect.

Gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays and DNaseI footprinting assays demonstrate that these negative regulatory sequences are recognized differently by proteins present in nuclear extracts obtained from HeLa and K562 cells.

The suppressive activity was lost in molecules, lacking the sugar moiety or the lipid moiety.

Furthermore, in time kinetics, gangliosides were effective for up to 30 min after addition of LPS, but not thereafter.

On the other hand, phorbol ester-induced production of O2- was similar in cells treated with and without gangliosides.

T cell-specific negative regulation of transcription of the human cytokine IL-4.

A novel T cell-specific negative regulatory element (NRE) composed of two protein-binding sites were mapped in the 5' flanking region of the IL-4 gene: -311CTCCCTTCT-303 (NRE-I) and -288CTTTTTGCTT-TGC-300 (NRE-II).

After 3 h incubation the specific binding power with [3H] Dex was decreased by 23.3 ± 10.0, 32.2 ± 13.2 and 54.3 ± 9.2% (P greater than 0.05, P greater than 0.05 and P less than 0.01 as compared with the control value of 100 in the absence of insulin) respectively in the presence of 20 mU/L (physiological testing concentration), 200 mU/L (physiological upper limit) and 2,000 mU/L (pharmacological concentration) insulin in the incubation medium.

In contrast, anti-AIM mAb did not induce any change in the binding activity of NF-kappa B, a transcription factor whose activity is also regulated by protein kinase C.

The increase in AP-1-binding activity was accompanied by the marked stimulation of the transcription of c-fos but not that of c-jun.

Surprisingly, however, neither of these proteins bound in vitro to EBS1 or EBS2.

These results can not be explained by receptor down-regulation due to higher levels of mineralocorticoids in PIH;

Mean values for plasma aldosterone were not different between the two groups, but significant differences were observed for MR (preeclampsia, 81 ± 44 receptors/cell; controls, 306 ± 168) and SPD (preeclampsia, 65 ± 7 mV; controls, 12 ± 5 mV).

In spite of its association with p50 in vitro, however, we found a lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor in vivo that contains c-Rel but not p50 epitopes;

Expression of the human RAR-alpha in receptor-negative erythroblasts conferred RA-induced regulation of differentiation to the otherwise unresponsive cells, thus showing that the RAR-alpha is essential for the RA effect.

Stability of the c-fos and c-jun mRNA was not affected by LTB4, as assessed after actinomycin D treatment.

no additional DNA segments with enhancer activity were identified in the human IL-4 gene.

The P sequence does not share homology with the 5' upstream sequence of the IL-2 gene, even though surrounding sequences of the IL-4 gene share high homology with the IL-2 gene.

Glucocorticoid receptor binding in three different cell types in major depressive disorder: lack of evidence of receptor binding defect.

2 . Mononuclear leukocytes binding to glucocorticoid correlated significantly with polymorphonuclear leukocytes binding to glucocorticoid, but both determinations failed to differentiate major depressive disorder and control subjects.

3 . Initial and post-dexamethasone in vitro fibroblast binding to glucocorticoid was not different between major depressive disorder and non-depressed control subjects.

Specific nuclear translocation of [3H]calcitriol/VDR was examined after exposure of whole cells to 10(-9) M/l calcitriol in the presence and absence of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled ligand and subsequent isolation of nuclei.

Pulse exposure of HL60 to radiolabeled hormone for 3 h followed by culture in medium without serum and calcitriol lead to nuclear retention of approximately 1600 radiolabeled VDR by 8 h and approximately 1000 VDR by 24 h.

No difference of VDR retention in pulse and pulse/chase-experiments was seen in PBL, where VDR halflife was approximately 30 min.

No specific translocation into the nuclear compartment was seen when isolated nuclei were incubated in [3H]calcitriol.

Radiolabeled hormone/receptor complexes of nuclei isolated from cells exposed for 3 h to radiolabeled hormone--in contrast to identical experiments with intact cells--did not disappear from the nuclear compartment upon incubation of nuclei with identical concentrations of the unlabeled compound.

No effect was seen in ethanol treated controls.

This report directly demonstrates that OTF-2 but not OTF-1 regulates the DRA gene.

In contrast, OTF-1-enriched protein fractions did not affect DRA gene transcription although it functionally enhanced the transcription of another gene.

In fibroblasts from patients with hereditary hypercholesteremia of homozygous type the number of glucocorticoid receptors did not exceed 10 % of their content in normal cells.

Tumor necrosis factor induced slightly c-fos and had almost no effect on c-jun and AP1.

Plasma aldosterone and cortisol and lymphocyte subsets were not different in the two groups.

These data show that aged subjects have reductions of corticosteroid receptors that are not associated with increase of related steroids and that this situation probably represents a concomitant of the normal aging process.

T3SO4 had no thyromimetic effect on the activity of Ca(2+)-ATPase in human erythrocyte membranes at doses up to 10,000 times the maximally effective dose of T3 (10(-10) mol/L).

In GH4C1 pituitary cells, T3SO4 failed to displace [125I]T3 from nuclear receptors in intact cells or soluble preparations.

Thus, T3SO4 was not directly thyromimetic in either an isolated human membrane system or a pituitary cell system in which nuclear receptor occupancy correlates with GH synthesis.

Propylthiouracil (50 mumol/L) did not affect the action of T3SO4, suggesting that deiodination was not important for this activity of T3SO4.

Thus, it appears  T3SO4 has no intrinsic biological activity, but , under certain circumstances, may be reactivated by desulfation.

Although NF-AT has not been cloned or purified, there is evidence that it is a major target for immunosuppression by cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 (refs 2-7).

Pretreatment with IFN-gamma potentiates the IFN-alpha-induced protection, but IFN-gamma alone does not have any antiviral activity.

ISG15 mRNA accumulation in U937 cells is not detectable before 6 h of IFN-alpha treatment, peaks at 24 h, and requires protein synthesis.

Although IFN-gamma alone does not induce ISG expression, IFN-gamma pretreatment markedly increases and hastens ISG expression and transcriptional induction.

Little effect was observed with 50-kDa forms of p105 NF-kappa B or rel, in combination with p65 or full-length c-rel, which do not stimulate the HIV enhancer in these cells.

Activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer is not dependent on NFAT-1.

The putative NFAT-1 region is not required for the response to anti-CD3 or to mitogens in T-cell, B-cell, or monocyte/macrophage leukemia lines, nor is it a cis-acting negative regulatory element.

Long term culture of TPA-differentiated U-937 cells in the absence of phorbol ester for 32-36 days resulted in a process of retrodifferentiation.

Moreover, this site is occupied by BSAP in vivo in a CD19-expressing B-cell line but not in plasma or HeLa cells.

PMA treatment induced CD3 and CD25 (IL-2R) receptors on the parental line and on other ethyl-methanesulfonate-derived subclones, but not on these two mutants.

Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assays using the HIV-1 ( -139 ) long terminal repeat-CAT construct showed no PMA induction of CAT activity in these subclones (unlike the parental line and other subclones).

Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatases 1 and 2A, did not overcome the defect in these subclones.

Thus, reduced levels of PKC-induced nuclear NF-kB activity in two T cell subclones did not affect their normal cell growth, but correlated with a pronounced reduction in their susceptibility to HIV-1 infection.

Except for PGF2 alpha, HHT and 15-HETE no detectable quantities of eicosanoids were found in the non-tumor material, whereas in the malignant tumor material substantial quantities of a number of eicosanoid metabolites were present.

c-myc did not correlate with c-fos and c-jun protein expression.

Stronger c-myc mRNA expression was detected in labial salivary glands of patients with longer disease duration (p less than or equal to 0.002) and more intense T lymphocyte infiltrates (p less than 0.05) although these patients revealed no hypergammaglobulinemia.

No correlation was observed between c-myc mRNA and B lymphocyte monoclonicity or lymphoma.

Transfection of an Fc gamma RII-negative B-cell line with complementary DNA 's encoding the two splice products and various receptor mutants indicated that the insertion was responsible for preventing both Fc gamma RII-mediated endocytosis and Fc gamma RII-mediated antigen presentation.

The insertion was not required for Fc gamma RII to modulate surface immunoglobulin-triggered B-cell activation.

In contrast, the insertion did contribute to the formation of caps in response to receptor cross-linking, consistent with suggestions that the lymphocyte but not macrophage form of the receptor can associate with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton.

While this expectation may be realized in some cases, we have not found evidence for it.

We found that the relative efficiency of the enhancers is approximately the same, irrespective of the type of promoter used, i.e. , there was no strong preference for any given enhancer/promoter combination.

Notably, we do not see particularly strong transcription when the immunoglobulin kappa enhancer ( or the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer) is used to activate a kappa gene promoter.

Furthermore, using DNA templates containing two copies of the PRDII domain linked to the rabbit beta globin gene, the purified polypeptides specifically stimulated NF-kappa B dependent transcription in an in vitro reconstitution assay as heterodimers but not as p50 homodimers.

Oct2 expression was unable to stimulate a multimerized octamer enhancer element in HeLa cells, however.

Moreover, this domain conferred enhancing activity when fused to the Oct1 protein, which by itself was unable to stimulate from a remote position.

The programmed activation/repression of transcription factors in early hematopoietic differentiation has not yet been explored.

Class II antigen expressing T-cell lines maintained contacts identical to B-cell lines, while class II-negative T-cell lines exhibited no interactions.

In contrast, the class II-positive nonlymphoid glioblastoma cell line does not exhibit interactions at the octamer site despite the presence of the ubiquitous OTF-1 factor and an open binding site.

Deletions in this promoter indicated that this upregulation was mediated through the NF-kappa B- but not the AP-1-binding motif, by bona fide p50/p65 heterodimers.

In contrast to the transient NF-kappa B activation induced by phorbol ester, the permanent NF-kappa B translocation induced by HIV infection was not dependent on PKC isoenzymes alpha and beta as shown by the use of a specific inhibitor (GF 109203X).

The details of the regulatory mechanism that selects particular loci for rearrangement are still not known.

It seems that the rearrangement of the TCR gamma loci in the gamma delta lineage may not always take place at a developmental stage strictly equivalent to the rearrangement of TCR beta in the alpha beta lineage, and it is not clear just how early the two lineages diverge.

Whereas peripheral T cells can undergo forms of positive selection (by antigen-driven clonal expansion) and negative selection (by abortive stimulation leading to anergy or death), neither is exactly the same phenomenon that occurs in the thymic cortex.

Negative selection in the cortex appears to be a suicidal inversion of antigen responsiveness:instead of turning on IL-2 expression, the activated cell destroys its own chromatin.

The genes that need to be induced for this response are not yet identified, but it is unquestionably a form of activation.

It is interesting that in humans and rats, cortical thymocytes undergoing negative selection can still induce IL-2R alpha expression and even be rescued in vitro, if exogenous IL-2 is provided.

Perhaps murine thymocytes are denied this form of rescue because they shut off IL-2R beta chain expression at an earlier stage or because they may be uncommonly Bcl-2 deficient (cf. Sentman et al. , 1991; Strasser et al. , 1991).

Even so, medullary thymocytes remain at least partially susceptible to negative selection even as they continue to mature.

CsA was found not to inhibit lck gene expression, nor the activity of the lck gene product.

A Tat-responsive element is found upstream within the viral promoter that in glial-derived cell lines allows transactivation in the absence of TAR.

PMA, which directly activates PKC, mimicked the effect of the lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun, but elevation of either intracellular Ca2+ or cAMP levels had little or no effect.

The protein expressed by the v-erb A oncogene binds to DNA and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of both the thyroid hormone receptor and the closely related retinoic acid receptor.

Threonine 78 lies within the D-box of the v-erb A protein, a region thought to mediate receptor-receptor dimerizations, and is not in physical proximity to the serine at position 61.

BSAP has been identified previously as a transcription factor that is expressed at early, but not late, stages of B-cell differentiation.

All of this evidence indicates that the transcription factor BSAP may not only play an important role in B-cell differentiation but also in neural development and spermatogenesis.

In contrast, no effect on the levels of the octamer binding proteins, Oct-1 or Oct-2, were found.

Although okadaic acid provides a potent inductive signal for AP-1 and NF-kappa B it did not induce either B cell proliferation or immunoglobulin secretion.

However, Nef does not affect the DNA-binding activity of other transcription factors implicated in HIV-1 regulation, including SP-1, USF, URS, and NF-AT.

These results indicate that defective recruitment of NF-kappa B may underlie Nef 's negative transcriptional effects on the HIV-1 and interleukin 2 promoters.

Activation of the IL-6 promoter by LTB4 was not only associated with accumulation of the respective transcripts but resulted in synthesis of functional IL-6 protein as well.

In addition, LTB4 mediated transactivation of a heterologous promoter construct containing the NF-chi B or the NF-IL6 enhancer, but not the AP-1 enhancer.

The signaling events mediating this effect appeared to involve the release of H2O2, since LTB4 failed to induce NF-chi B or NF-IL6 in the presence of the scavenger of H2O2, N-acetyl-L-cysteine.

Their action mechanism is not completely cleared.

The estrogens participate in the regulation of practically all the reproductive and sexual events of the female, although the intracellular actions by which they take place are not well known and the proposed models do not adequately satisfy the questions.

Currently it is accepted the existence of a cytoplasmic and/or nuclear receptor, without explaining satisfactorily how the hormones come to the nucleus.

To determine whether such transdominant Rev proteins could provide long-term protection against HIV infection without affecting T cell function, T leukemia cell lines were stably transduced with a retroviral vector encoding a transdominant mutant of the Rev protein, M10.

While all the M10-expressing cell lines remained infectable by HIV-1, these same cells failed to support a productive replication cycle when infected with a cloned isolate of HIV-1.

Expression of M10 did not affect induction of HIV transcription mediated by the kappa B regulatory element or Tat.

Importantly, constitutive expression of Rev M10 did not alter the secretion of interleukin 2 in response to mitogen stimulation of EL-4 and Jurkat cells.

The inhibition of HIV infection in cells stably expressing a transdominant Rev protein, in the absence of any deleterious effect on T cell function, suggests that such a strategy could provide a therapeutic effect in the T lymphocytes of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients.

However, these studies have used a limited number of known kappa B DNA motifs, and the question of the optimal DNA sequences preferred by each homodimer has not been addressed.

Contrary to previous assumptions, we observed that p65 homodimers can interact with a subset of DNA sequences not recognized by p50 homodimers.

Using either a p50- or p65-selected kappa B motif, which displayed differential binding with respect to the other protein, little to no binding was observed with the heterodimeric NF-kappa B complex.

Similarly, in transfection experiments in which the selective kappa B binding sites were used to drive the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct, the p65- and p50-selected motifs were activated only in the presence of p65 and p50/65 (a chimeric protein with the p50 DNA binding domain and p65 activation domain) expression vectors, respectively, and neither demonstrated a significant response to stimuli that induce NF-kappa B activity.

We have biochemically and functionally characterized a new transcription factor, NP-TCII, which is present in nuclei from unstimulated T and B lymphocytes but is not found in nonhematopoietic cells.

No biological function has yet been described for Bcl-3, but it was noted recently that Bcl-3 interferes with DNA-binding of the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B in vitro.

On the first day of the disease, glucocorticoid receptor capacity was significantly decreased without alteration of the receptor-ligand affinity, whereas on days 4 and 12 the number of receptor sites was normal again.

Since previous studies have demonstrated that the c-jun gene is autoinduced by Jun/AP-1, we also studied transcription of c-jun promoter (positions -132/+170)-reporter gene constructs with and without a mutated AP-1 element.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Similarly, IL-2 activates NF-kappa B in the human monocytic cell line U 937, but not in resting human T-cells.

The average values from healthy volunteers did not differ significantly from those found in these children, though much broader range was found in patients.

OCA-B stimulates the transcription from an IgH promoter in conjunction with either Oct-1 or Oct-2 but shows no significant effect on the octamer/Oct-dependent transcription of the ubiquitously expressed histone H2B promoter and the transcription of USF- and Sp1-regulated promoters.

Analysis of a series of 5'-truncations showed several peaks of basal and PMA induced activity suggesting the presence of several positive and negative regulatory elements.

BHA was found to suppress not only PMA- or TNF-induced, but also constitutive, HIV-enhancer activity concomitant to an inhibition of NF-kappa B binding activity in both lymphoblastoid T (J.Jhan) and monocytic (U937) cell lines.

The anti-oxidative effect of BHA was accompanied by an increase in thiol, but not glutathione, content in stimulated and unstimulated T cell, whereas TNF stimulation itself barely modified the cellular thiol level.

Oxidative stress obtained by the addition of H2O2 to the culture medium of J.Jhan or U937 cells could not by itself induce NF-kappa B activation.

These observations suggest that TNF and PMA do not lead to NF-kappa B activation through induction of changes in the cell redox status.

In PHA-activated PBL, no age-related differences were observed in c-fos or jun B mRNA expression.

No age-related differences were found in the expression of either of these two proto-oncogenes by anti-CD2 activated T cells.

Characterization of a novel T lymphocyte protein which binds to a site related to steroid/thyroid hormone receptor response elements in the negative regulatory sequence of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat.

Corticosteroids are the preeminent antiinflammatory agents although the molecular mechanisms that impart their efficacy have not been defined.

Moreover, the steroid receptor agonist cortisol (10 microM), but not its inactive metabolite tetrahydrocortisol (10 microM), diminished LPS-induced endothelial cell adhesiveness.

As in the adhesion studies, cortisol but not tetrahydrocortisol inhibited expression of ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 (both P &lt; 0.005, n = 3 or 4)9.

In contrast, sodium salicylate (1 mM) inhibited neither adhesion nor expression of these adhesion molecules.

REVs do not encode a transactivator targeted to the viral LTR, and cells infected with Marek 's disease virus, a herpesvirus with an overlapping host range, do not express factors that preferentially enhance expression from REV or avian sarcoma/leukemia virus LTRs.

No positive effect of the duplicated CTG-motif could be detected.

The mechanism of HS2 enhancer function is not known.

In nonerythroid HL-60 cells in which the HS2 enhancer is inactive, long enhancer transcripts are not detectable.

In THP-1 cells, TPA also induced a new, faster-migrating NF kappa B species not induced in monocytes.

Protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine, but not cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor HA-1004, also dramatically reduced constitutive levels of nuclear NF kappa B.

In contrast, antisense inhibition of Tax itself had no apparent effect on cell growth.

Proliferation of T cells was induced by immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the presence or absence of an additional costimulatory signal delivered by anti-CD28 mAb.

Synergistic suppression of T-cell proliferation was observed when various concentrations of DEX and PGE2, but not DEX and ISO, were added to cultures.

This synergistic suppression could not be explained by an increase in cAMP accumulation in T cells stimulated with DEX and PGE2.

Targeted degradation of c-Fos, but not v-Fos, by a phosphorylation-dependent signal on c-Jun.

c-Jun protein isolated from phorbol ester-induced cells did not target c-Fos for degradation, which suggests that c-Fos is transiently stabilized after stimulation of cell growth.

v-Fos protein, the retroviral counterpart of c-Fos, was not susceptible to degradation targeted by c-Jun.

No unifying hypothesis has yet emerged explaining this collection of data.

In addition, monocytes and IFN-U937 cells both responded to red cells sensitized with antibodies against a variety of specificities of assumed ( although not documented) clinical significance for blood transfusion recipients.

In contrast, monocytes and IFN-U937 cells responded only weakly to red cells sensitized with either anti-D in sera from mothers of babies unaffected by HDN, or with antisera containing high titre antibodies with specificities not normally associated with significantly reduced red cell survival.

The second (-365/-264) binds to nuclear factors, which appear to be different in basophils and T cells, and acts as a negative element in basophils and as a positive one in T cells.

Thus, this Alu repeat (90% identical to Alu consensus sequences) has evolved to become both a positive and negative regulator.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed significant aldosterone binding at a molecular weight of approximately 50000 Dalton which was absent with 1 microM cold aldosterone, but not cortisol in the binding media.

The presence of the sulfhydryl agent dithiothreitol did not affect results suggesting the absence of disulfide bridges in the steroid binding domain of the receptor.

IL-4 did not affect the stability of the c-fos and c-jun transcripts.

The ras-transformed lymphocytes displayed a fully functional IL-2r, as assessed by c-fos induction following treatment with IL-2; nevertheless, they were not growth stimulated by this lymphokine.

Somewhat unexpectedly, the constitutive p21ras activity did not cause an increased DNA binding of transcription factors PEA1 (AP1), PEA3, Oct-2 or NF-kB.

We can now study regulatory regions and functional domains of the protein in the context of a true erythroid environment, experiments that have not been possible heretofore.

If they can not, chimeric proteins can be tested to identify which amino acids distinguish the different family members.

We have isolated cDNA clones of myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD) genes, activated in the absence of de novo protein synthesis following induction for differentiation along either the macrophage or granulocyte lineage in human myeloblastic leukemia HL-60 cells.

HL-60 cells constitutively expressing an Egr-1 transgene (HL-60Egr-1) could be induced for macrophage, but not granulocyte, differentiation.

The trans-activation domain of E2 and Tax is interchangeable although they have no obvious sequence homology between them.

The viral trans-activators appear to target specific DNA binding protein such as NF-kB and Sp1 to cis-acting DNA site and promote lymphokine gene expression without TCR-mediated stimulation.

In immature hematopoietic cells, tal-1 and GATA-1 genes are coexpressed in committed progenitors cells (CD34+/CD38(2+)), whereas they are not detectable in the most primitive cells (CD34(2+)/CD38-).

Transactivation of PTHrP by Tax was seen in T cells but not in B-cell lines or fibroblasts.

A carboxy terminal Tax deletion mutant was deficient in transactivation of both the PTHrP and IL2R alpha promoters but not the HTLV-I long terminal repeat (LTR).

Exogenous provision of NFkB rescued IL2R alpha expression but not the PTHrP promoter.

This region binds an inducible, T-cell-specific factor over its 5' end, a site that is necessary for the expression of IL-3 in the absence of other upstream elements.

Furthermore, and despite a lack of sequence homology, the promoters of IL-3 and IL-2 share an organizational pattern of regulatory elements that is likely to be important for the T-cell-specific expression of these genes.

In contrast, NF-kappa B p50 alone fails to stimulate kappa B-directed transcription, and based on prior in vitro studies, is not directly regulated by I kappa B.

However, no loss of DNA binding activity is observed, presumably reflecting the unique C-terminal domain that is distinct from that present in NF-kappa B p65.

Using flow cytometry, we detected surrogate TG receptors on non-T ( but not on T) cells from 11 of 11 individuals studied (5 Hashimoto patients and 6 control donors).

This low frequency of response was no different from that previously detected using cultures of T cells and autologous dendritic cells.

Therefore, the successful generation of surrogate receptors on non-T cells is not associated with more efficient TG presentation of T cells.

Furthermore, the significance of the present study is that the T cells, not the antigen-presenting cells, are likely to be the limiting element in the T cell proliferative response to TG and other thyroid autoantigens.

To identify an EBNA2 dependent cis-acting element, various TP1 promoter-reporter gene constructs were transfected in the absence and presence of an EBNA2 expression vector into the established B-cell line BL41-P3HR1.

Two of these were not cell type specific, but the third was detected only in EBNA2 positive cell extracts.

In cotransfection experiments, oncogenic rats obviated the need for PKC stimulation but did not replace either the calcium signal or interleukin-1.

Overexpression of cJun or JunD, but not JunB, also eliminates the requirement for PMA, indicating that many but not all Jun- and Fos-related proteins functionally activate NF-AT-dependent transcription in the presence of the cytoplasmic component.

Fos proteins are not needed for this reconstitution, and although JunB is not functional, it can participate in the NF-AT DNA binding complex.

These inhibitory effects of c-Rel correlate with its DNA-binding activity but not with its ability to heterodimerize with p50, suggesting that c-Rel inhibition involves competition with p50/p65 for occupancy of the kappa B enhancer element.

To further evaluate the role of X box DNA-binding proteins in class II gene expression, the role of the X box region was examined in both class II-positive and -negative lymphoid cells.

In addition to the wild-type B cell line Raji, two class II transcriptional mutant cell lines, SJO and RJ2.2.5, and Jurkat, a class II negative T cell line, were examined.

In contrast to wild-type B cells, neither of the class II mutant cell lines could use the X box region to direct the expression of a transiently transfected reporter gene, indicating that the X box-dependent transcriptional pathway is defective in these cells.

The binding activity of the X1 box DNA-binding protein RFX was examined and found to be present in wild-type B cells and the mutant RJ2.2.5 but was absent in SJO and Jurkat.

A similar comparison with protease-treated extracts prepared from Jurkat cells demonstrated the presence of the band 1pk activity despite an absence of the native RFX activity.

In contrast, protease treatment and analysis of SJO extracts showed no detectable levels of the band 1pk activity.

Three mutants (-201/-184 NXS, -165/-148 NXS, and -147/-130 NXS) had effects on viral replication that were much more severe than the effects predicted from their performance in transfection analyses, and the effects of two LS mutations (-201/-184 NXS and -183/-166 NXS) were not predicted by their effects in transfection.

In the cell types tested, the LS mutations indicated an apparent requirement not only for the intact NF-kappa B and SP1-binding sites but also for several regions between -201 and -130 not previously associated with viral infectivity.

When ligated to the proIL-1 beta cap site-proximal region (located between -131 to +12), both the proIL-1 beta and the simian virus 40 enhancer elements functioned more efficiently in monocytes than in HeLa cells, which are not normally competent for IL-1 beta expression.

In contrast to T cells, in fibroblasts PILOT gene expression requires only one signal (PMA) and is not affected by CyA.

This observation directly demonstrates the existence of a Ca2+ signal-dependent regulatory element obligatory for expression of some genes in T cells but not in fibroblasts.

Control peptides corresponding to the normal pml and RAR alpha proteins were not recognized.

It is concluded that the bcr1 type-pml/RAR alpha fusion protein of APL contains an antigenic site, absent from the normal parent molecules and recognized by human CD4+ lymphocytes.

In gel-shift assays, the -1280 element and the c-fos SRE cross-competed, whereas their functional and binding mutants did not.

Methylation interference analysis of the -65 region identified a pattern of contacts with nuclear factors resembling that for NF-Y, and an NF-Y-binding site and the proximal TSP 1 element cross-competed in gel-shift assays, whereas their binding mutants did not.

Hemin induction of K562 cells does not facilitate the binding of NF-E2 to its recognition site.

No such increase was observed in control U937 cells.

Although the -20 GATA binding site (AGATAA) is also a potential TFIID binding site, it does not bind TFIID.

Proliferation to tetanus toxoid did not differ significantly between the groups.

Responses to jun-B were not related to age, sex, or human leukocyte antigen status.

Site-directed mutagenesis further demonstrated that the enhancer function of one of the two NF-E2/AP1 motifs of HS-40 is mediated through its binding to NF-E2 but not AP1 transcription factor.

All sequence motifs within the functional core of HS-40, as mapped by transient expression analysis, appeared to bind a nuclear factor ( s ) in living K562 cells but not in nonerythroid cells.

This activation was not observed in undifferentiated embryocarcinoma F9 cells.

Using the DNA affinity precipitation assay, we observed that Tax1 is able to efficiently induce the binding of Rel, whereas PMA is not.

The Rel/NF-kappa B family of transcription factors is composed of two distinct subgroups, proteins that undergo proteolytic processing and contain SWI6/ankyrin repeats in their carboxyl termini (p105, p98), and those without such repeats that do not require processing (p65, c-Rel, RelB, and Dorsal).

These observations suggest a second pathway leading to NF-kappa B induction, in which processing of the precursors rather than phosphorylation of I kappa B plays a major role.

In contrast to MEL cells, however, K562 cells acquired a macrophage-like morphology and exhibited a complete failure to generate benzidine-positive cells.

No upregulation of megakaryocyte or lymphoid markers occurred.

In vivo the Sp1 site is bound only in myeloid (U937) cells, not in cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells.

PBL constitutively express c-jun transcripts, and the level of c-jun mRNA is not altered by PHA activation in the absence or presence of EC.

In contrast, c-fos mRNA is absent from resting T cells and is induced on PHA activation.

EC alone do not induce c-fos mRNA but augment the level of c-fos mRNA in PHA-activated T cells by 3- to 10-fold.

Gel-shift analysis reveals the constitutive presence of nuclear factors in resting PBL that bind to the proximal AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter and that contain immunoreactive c-Jun but not c-Fos protein.

Levels of other nuclear factors involved in IL-2 regulation were not altered by EC, although NFAT-DNA complexes migrated at a slightly different mobility.

The composition of NF-AT protein is still not fully elucidated.

There was no detectable binding of in vitro translated Jun/Fos heterodimer (AP-1) to the NF-AT sequence, and the NF-AT sequence was unable to inhibit the binding of Jun/Fos to the AP-1 sequence.

In contrast, U-937 cells induced by RA strongly increased their expression of CD23 mRNA and protein, whereas they completely lacked detectable CD14 cell surface or mRNA expression.

No lytic effect on the reporter cells could be measured, neither by cocultivation of activator cells nor by coincubation of BZLF 1-containing cell lysates.

Negative transcriptional regulation of human interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene by glucocorticoids through interference with nuclear transcription factors AP-1 and NF-AT.

Both Dex and CsA inhibited the binding of transcription factors AP-1 and NF-AT, but not of NF-kB and OCT-1/OAF, to their corresponding sites on the IL-2 gene promoter.

Dex inhibited the IL-2 promoter and the AP-1, but not the NF-AT and NF-kB plasmids.

In contrast, CsA inhibited the IL-2 promoter and the NF-AT, but not the AP-1 and NF-kB plasmids.

The expression of hGATA-3, a T cell-specific factor known to be involved in the regulation of the transcription of TcR delta locus, was analyzed by Northern blot, in cultured NK cell population and clones ( but not in freshly derived cell populations).

Finally, no transcription of the RAG-1 gene could be detected in all NK cell lines or clones analyzed.

To determine whether Nef affects the binding of cellular factors implicated in HIV-1 regulation, 32P-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the binding sites were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from Nef-expressing T-cell lines that were not stimulated or were stimulated with T-cell mitogens.

Mitogen-mediated transcriptional activation of the CAT gene in this construct was inhibited in Nef-expressing cells but not in control cells.

These results can not be explained by receptor down-regulation due to higher level of mineralocorticoids of the zona glomerulosa.

The data show that hypertension in preeclamptic women can be treated by Urapidil without side effects or reflex-tachycardia.

Functional studies in extrarenal, non-epithelial cells such as smooth muscle cells and more recently circulating human lymphocytes have provided increasing evidence that aldosterone produces not only classical genomic effects, but also rapid, non-genomic effects on transmembrane electrolyte movements.

Such changes clearly can not be explained by genomic mechanisms, which are responsible for later effects than the membrane related rapid responses.

IFN-MCP was not inhibited by infection with dl343, despite the production of large amounts of both early (E1B, p55) and late (hexon) Ad proteins.

In contrast to E1A-negative, parental cell lines, IFN-MCP was blocked in Ad5 E1A-transfected epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines.

In contrast to the type I receptor, the type II IL-1R has a small cytoplasmic tail, and it is not clear whether this receptor is a signal-transducing or a regulatory molecule.

Here we report that the type II IL-1R does not mediate gene activation in Jurkat cells.

The precise molecular abnormalities that cause primary cortisol resistance have not been completely described.

Cells from TNFRp55-/-mutant mice lack expression of TNFRp55 but display normal numbers of high affinity TNFRp75 molecules.

Thymocyte development and lymphocyte populations are unaltered, and clonal deletion of potentially self-reactive T cells is not impaired.

However, TNF signaling is largely abolished, as judged by the failure of TNF to induce NF-kappa B in T lymphocytes from TNFRp55-deficient mice.

The cDNA hybridized to multiple transcripts in pre-B and B-cell lines, but transcripts were not detected at significant levels in plasmacytoma, T-cell, and nonlymphoid cell lines.

Analysis of DNA binding by deletion mutants of EBF identified an amino-terminal cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain lacking obvious sequence similarity to known transcription factors.

However, the molecular basis for the commitment of progenitors to the eosinophil lineage has not been determined.

Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma.

This potent interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) -dependent activation does not require monocytes or accessory cells.

TSH-R expression levels were variable, but displayed a close correlation to the expression of thyroid peroxidase (r = 0.703; P &lt; 0.05), thyroglobulin (r = 0.817; P &lt; 0.01), and the nuclear oncogene c-fos (r = 0.935; P &lt; 0.001), but not c-myc.

Overall, TSH-R transcript levels were low or absent in those thyroids in which expression of the major histocompatibility complex class I or II (MHC I or II) was high, thus establishing an inverse relation (MHC I, r = -0.791; P &lt; 0.01; MHC II, r = -0.784; P &lt; 0.01).

Thus p59fyn could replace the calcium ionophore but not activation of protein kinase C.

The presence of c-fos had a negative influence on GR function and correlated with the cell-specific synergistic or antagonistic activity of Jun with respect to GR;

high basal expression of c-fos as well as AP-1 DNA binding and transcriptional activity were observed in HeLa cells, but not in T cells.

These phenotypic effects are specifically attributable to the action of ectopically expressed GATA-2/ER because erythroblasts expressing exogenous GATA-2 are constitutively arrested in differentiation and because erythroid progenitors expressing either Gal/ER or GATA-3/ER do not display a hormone-responsive block in differentiation.

By comparison, there was no modification of the expression of CD4 antigen, which is expressed at high levels in these cells.

In contrast, there was no regulation by glucocorticoids of either the CD8 or CD4 antigens in the leukemic clone CEM C1.

Furthermore, no modification of the suppressor function in CEM C1 cells by dexamethasone was observed.

The results demonstrate that multidrug-resistant HL-60 cells, designated HL-60/vinc, fail to respond to TPA with an increase in c-jun transcripts or other phenotypic characteristics of monocytic differentiation.

The finding that HL-60/vinc/R cells respond to TPA with induction of a monocytic phenotype, but not c-jun expression, suggests that c-jun induction is not obligatory for monocytic differentiation.

Activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family with associated phosphorylation of c-Jun Y-peptide was markedly diminished in TPA-treated HL-60/vinc cells, but not in response to okadaic acid.

Further examination of this system has shown that the inhibition of HSV-1 replication by the antiviral drug acyclovir does not inhibit HSV-1-mediated induction of HIV-1 provirus.

In the transient-transfection assay, ICP0, but not ICP4, activated the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter region and the effect of ICP0 was greatly enhanced in the presence of the NF-kappa B binding proteins, suggesting that induction of the HIV-1 provirus involves cooperation between the HSV-1-activated cellular factor, NF-kappa B, and the virus-encoded transactivator, ICP0.

4 patients were receiving dopamine, which did not affect the GR count.

Despite a wide range, the mean GR count and affinity in MNC from septic patients did not differ from those in normal controls, suggesting that glucocorticoids could still be effective in the hemodynamic compensatory phase of sepsis.

The results were compared to those obtained with the parental granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) -dependent cell line, UT-7, which has a predominantly megakaryoblastic phenotype and is unable to proliferate continuously in the presence of Epo.

By Northern analysis, UT-7 cells expressed detectable levels of beta- and gamma-globin but not alpha-globin.

Globin chains (alpha, beta and gamma) were clearly detectable by affinity chromatography in UT-7 Epo but not in UT-7 cells.

The levels of GATA-1, Epo-R and globin mRNA expressed were not affected by a 24-hour incubation of either cell line with Epo, GM-CSF or interleukin-3 (IL-3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Human peripheral blood monocytes (Mo) constitutively display the beta-chain of the receptor for IL-2, whereas expression of the IL-2R alpha-chain is not constitutive but inducible with IL-2.

The B cell NFAT complex, however, was not functional, since it failed to activate transcription from an NFAT-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct.

Purified recombinant Jun and Fos proteins failed to bind directly to the NFAT motif.

However, when combined with unstimulated B or T cell extracts, full-length, but not truncated, Jun/Fos heterodimers were able to form an NFAT complex, indicating the presence of a constitutively expressed nuclear factor ( s ) in B and T cells necessary for the formation of the NFAT complex in both cell types.

An NFAT oligonucleotide carrying mutations in the 5' purine-rich part of the NFAT sequence failed to form a complex and to compete with the wild type motif for NFAT complex formation in both T and B cells.

Thus, positive autoregulation is neither a consequence nor the sole cause of growth arrest.

The degree of negative autoregulation in IM-9 cells and positive autoregulation in 6TG1.1 cells was unaffected by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide.

In contrast, p65 delta, a naturally occurring splice variant, fails to markedly augment I kappa B protein levels.

However, X failed to react with a variety of antibodies against Rb or p107, implicating the involvement of an E1A-binding protein other than Rb or p107.

UV cross-linking experiments suggested that a distinct E2F DNA-binding protein is uniquely associated with the S-phase p107 complex and is not associated with Rb.

Occurrence of a silencer of the interleukin-2 gene in naive but not in memory resting T helper lymphocytes.

By contrast, memory cells, either in vitro activated helper T cells reverting to a resting state, or CD4+ T ( memory ) clones, or CD4+CD45RO+ T cells isolated ex vivo, no longer have a silencer.

We have previously shown that minimally oxidized LDL (MM-LDL) activated endothelial cells to increase their interaction with monocytes but not neutrophils, inducing monocyte but not neutrophil binding and synthesis of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).

Both induction of monocyte binding and mRNA levels for M-CSF by MM-LDL were not inhibited in protein kinase C-depleted endothelial cells.

Although endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM) mRNA synthesis can be regulated by NF kappa B, ELAM was not expressed and ELAM mRNA was only slightly elevated in response to MM-LDL.

However, the p65 antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide had no significant effect on the production of reactive oxygen intermediates or on phagocytosis by these cells.

Remarkably, we observed that these samples displayed a persistent expression of the c-fos protooncogene, associated to an increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity, whereas no variations of CREB or NF-kB were detected.

Neither Bt2cAMP nor PMA individually mediated these sustained effects, which therefore appear as a consequence of the interplay between both metabolic stimuli.

On the contrary, other steroid hormones such as Tx, progesterone, and testosterone had no effect.

RESULTS : In the OM-10.1 promyelocytic model of chronic infection, TNF-alpha-induced HIV-1 expression also resulted in a substantial increase in 75 kd TNF receptor (TR75) expression although 55 kD TNF receptor (TR55) levels were not dramatically altered.

Antibody cross-linking of TR55, in the absence of exogenous TNF-alpha, induced maximal HIV-1 expression, an up-modulation of surface TR75, and nuclear NF-kappa B activity in OM-10.1 cultures.

They do not directly intercept intracellular signalling molecules.

So far, there are no drugs or therapy available that can provide protection against HIV-1 latency reactivation.

Nuclei of lymphocytes from FDC clusters were negative.

p65 was detected in the cytoplasm of FDC, whereas nuclei were negative.

c-Rel protein was detected only in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes and not in the nucleus and cytoplasm of FDC.

The hypothesis to be tested was whether or not humans exhibit a similar susceptibility to PCDDs/PCDFs with respect to the surface receptors found previously to respond to small doses of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in Callithrix jacchus.

There were two main goals: ( 1 ) to evaluate whether workers with a moderately increased PCDD/PCDF-body burden [25-140 ppt TCDD or 104-522 ppt I-TE in blood fat] exhibit changes in the surface receptors of white blood cells, as observed in previous studies in non-human primates, and ( 2 ) to clarify whether persons at the upper range [10-23 ppt TCDD or 30-90 ppt I-TE in blood fat] of the body burden reference values of a not particularly exposed population show detectable deviations in these immunological variables, when compared with persons at the lower and medium range [1-3 ppt TCDD or 9-29 ppt I-TE] of these body burden reference values.

None of the alterations observed are of medical relevance.

Altogether, the data do not provide any evidence to support an assumption that moderately increased body burdens of PCDDs/PCDFs in adults induce decreases in the cellular components of the human immune system.

Tax was transfected into HTLV-I-negative human T-cell lines.

In JM T cells, tax induced LT-293 activity by two- to four-fold, though there was no induction of M1-CAT.

Increased natural killer cell activity correlates with low or negative expression of the HER-2/neu oncogene in patients with breast cancer.

Within this group of patients, NK cell activity was significantly lower (45.6 ± 16.1%) compared with the group with no HER-2/neu overexpression (57.3 ± 11.0%).

NK cell activity did not increase in patients with HER-2/neu overexpression.

Thus, there was a statistically significant correlation of cytolytic effector cell function with HER-2/neu expression of the tumor (P = 0.003), and HER-2/neu overexpression correlated with a negative estrogen receptor status (P = 0.005).

This effect required surface expression of the CD45 PTPase and was not observed in CD45-deficient variants of Jurkat cells.

In the CD45-negative variant, the effect of pervanadate on tyrosine phosphorylation was globally decreased and some phosphorylated substrates were specifically missing.

We thus conclude that PTPases play a crucial role in the negative regulation of signal transduction culminating in T-lymphocyte activation.

Patients were classified as steroid sensitive (SS) if their morning FEV1 increased &gt; 30% after a 1-wk course of oral prednisone 20 mg twice daily and steroid resistant (SR) if they failed to increase &gt; 15%.

The other two SR patients had an abnormally low GR number with normal binding affinity that was not limited to T cells.

Furthermore, GR number failed to normalize after incubation in media alone or IL-2 and IL-4.

Rhabdomyosarcomas do not contain mutations in the DNA binding domains of myogenic transcription factors.

However, their specific function in these processes has not been clearly defined.

Additionally, IFN-gamma activity but not IL-1, IL-2, or IL-4 activity was present in culture supernatants 72 h after R24 stimulation.

Furthermore, R24 treatment resulted in translocation of c-rel, but little or no NF kappa B p50 or p65, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and an increase of NF kappa B binding complexes containing c-rel and p50.

Additionally, herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the R24-stimulated increase in proliferation but not cytotoxicity at concentrations consistent with specificity for tyrosine kinases.

Overexpression of full-length SCL protein in the lymphoid cell lines, SupT1 and Raji, did not alter cell phenotype and there was no evidence for autoregulation of SCL transcription.

The GM-CSF gene is not expressed in resting peripheral blood T cells but is rapidly induced at the transcriptional level following activation through the cell surface T-cell receptor.

In addition, we identify a major PB1 nuclear protein-binding complex that is not present in resting peripheral blood T cells but is rapidly induced following T-cell activation.

HTLV-I encodes an essential 40-kDa protein termed Tax that not only transactivates the long terminal repeat of this retrovirus but also induces an array of cellular genes.

In contrast, a mutant of Tax that selectively fails to activate nuclear NF-kappa B expression does not associate with p100.

The BZLF1 gene promoter (Zp) was activated by crosslinking of cell surface immunoglobulin (Ig) with anti-Ig antibody in B cells, even in the absence of other viral genes.

This shift is apparently not caused by a recruitment phenomenon, because in FCS+ culture, the total number of colonies is not significantly modified by RA addition.

Studies on RA time-response or pulse treatment in semisolid or liquid culture show that early RA addition is most effective, thus indicating that early but not late HPC are sensitive to its action.

We measured effects on the HIV-1 LTR in T cell lines that were stimulated with antibodies against CD45 and in those that lacked the expression of CD45 on their surfaces.

First, anti-CD45 antibodies did not affect basal but decreased activated levels of expression from the HIV-1 LTR.

Second, T cells, which lack CD45 and can not signal via the TCR, supported higher levels of viral replication and gene expression.

Egr-1 mRNA expression induced by sIgM- and sIgD-crosslinking was inhibited by H7, erbstatin and genistein, but not by HA1004.

Phorbol myristate acetate induced Egr-1 mRNA expression but forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not.

Cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 rescued B104 cells from death induced by anti-IgM Ab, but did not affect the expression of Egr-1 and c-fos mRNA, showing that CsA and FK506 affect signal transducers differently from or downstream to these molecules.

By using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, it was shown that G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-6 mRNA expression depends on the synthesis of new protein, whereas G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation does not.

The IRF-2 promoter region contains a CpG island, with several GC boxes, a putative NF-kappa B-binding site, and a CAAT box, but no TATA box.

These data suggest that interferon regulatory factor 1 not only triggers the activation of the interferon signal transduction pathway, but also may play a role in limiting the duration of this response by activating the transcription of IRF-2.

G-CSF receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, but activation of the receptor results in the rapid induction of tyrosine kinase activity.

The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c-rel was unique to G-CSF in that granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor which also stimulates neutrophils and induces tyrosine phosphorylation does not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c-rel.

The consequences of p80c-rel tyrosine phosphorylation are not yet known;

Subsequent studies have revealed that ( i ) cytoplasmic RelA is stably associated not only with I kappa B alpha but also with other ankyrin motif-rich proteins including the products of the NF-kappa B2 (p100) and NF-kappa B1 (p105) genes; ( ii ) in contrast to RelA-I kappa B alpha, RelA-p100 cytoplasmic complexes are not dissociated following tumor necrosis factor alpha activation; ( iii ) p100 functions as a potent inhibitor of RelA-mediated transcription in vivo; ( iv ) the interaction of RelA and p100 involves the conserved Rel homology domain of both proteins but not the nuclear localization signal of RelA, which is required for I kappa B alpha binding; ( v ) p100 inhibition of RelA function requires the C-terminal ankyrin motif domain, which mediates cytoplasmic retention of RelA; and ( vi ) as observed with I kappa B alpha, nuclear RelA stimulates p100 mRNA and protein expression.

Because erythrocytes are anucleated, these results are discussed as evidence for biochemical changes by TCDD without requiring the activation of gene products.

Northern blot analyses performed on rat and mouse tissues have detected ubiquitously expressed Pan transcripts, but the abundance, distribution, and form of Pan proteins have not been clearly defined.

IEF-1, a pancreatic beta-cell type-specific complex believed to regulate insulin expression, is demonstrated to consist of at least two distinct species, one of which does not contain Pan molecules.

Interferon alpha selectively affects expression of the human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen in late stage cells in the monocytic but not the granulocytic lineage.

The effects of phorbol ester on MNDA mRNA appeared to be associated with induced differentiation since inhibiting cell proliferation did not alter the level of MNDA mRNA and cell cycle variation in MNDA mRNA levels were not observed.

The constitutively active type of the CN A subunit, which lacks the auto-inhibitory and calmodulin-binding domains, acts in synergy with PMA to activate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter.

Functional studies in extra-renal, nonepithelial cells such as smooth muscle cells and more recently circulating human lymphocytes have provided increasing evidence that aldosterone produces not only classical genomic effects, but also rapid non-genomic effects on transmembrane electrolyte movements.

Such changes clearly can not be explained by genomic mechanisms, which are responsible for later effects than the membrane-related rapid responses.

In T cells stimulated with purified phytohemagglutinin (PHA-p) and 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) addition of DM to the cultures resulted in a 60 % reduction in IL-2R alpha and a 30 % reduction in IL-2R beta membrane expression compared to T cells cultured in the absence of DM (p &lt; 0.01).

The data indicate that 10(-6) M DM increased T cell p50 NF-kappa B mRNA levels by four-fold compared to the levels obtained in the absence of DM.

In this investigation an enhanced and prolonged IL-2 and IL-2 mRNA response was also detected in both stimulated (T cell mitogens or alloantigens) murine splenocytes and in the stimulated murine T cell line EL-4 in the presence of ciprofloxacin (5-80 micrograms/ml) as compared to control cells without antibiotics.

In addition, EL-4 cells incubated with ciprofloxacin showed an early peak and more activated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT-1) as compared to control cells without antibiotics.

Cipro did not affect the nuclear transcription factors AP-1 or NFIL-2A.

The sequence between -1.7 and -0.2 kb linked to a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter failed to respond to PRL stimulation, suggesting that the activity of upstream PRL response elements may require an interaction with promoter-proximal elements.

Analysis at the phenotype and genetic level showed that lack of CD5 expression was due neither to segregation of human autosome 11, on which the CD5 gene has been mapped, nor to deletion of the CD5 structural gene.

Furthermore, loss of CD5 surface expression correlated with the absence of specific mRNA.

Breast tissue biomarkers which accurately predict breast cancer development within a 10 year period in high risk women are needed but currently not available.

Low risk women were those without these or other major identifiable risk factors.

The difference in the prevalence of ER overexpression between high and low risk groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.095).

No difference in plasma cortisol level was found between asthmatics and healthy subjects.

These findings suggest that there is no primary and general impairment of glucocorticoid metabolism in the asthmatics, but the number of GCR in the asthmatics is lower than that in healthy controls.

This atrophy induction does not involve apoptotic mechanisms in thymocytes affected by the bcl-2 proto-oncogene.

TCDD mediates atrophy induction through its specific receptor (the AhR) and not through effects on the estrogen receptor.

We observed no change in membrane structural order with RU 486 up to a concentration of 10(-4) M.

The mechanism by which NF-ATc enters the nucleus is unknown, and although it appears to require calcineurin, NF-ATc has not yet been shown to be an in vivo substrate of calcineurin.

Although NF-ATp copurifies with NF-ATc, there is as yet no understanding of how NF-ATp is functioning in vivo.

The T3- group showed no change in MBC over the study.

Although no proof yet exists of a role for these lesions in DLCL pathogenesis, the feature of the BCL-6 gene product, its specific pattern of expression in B cells, and the clustering of lesions disrupting its regulatory domain strongly suggest that deregulation of BCL-6 expression may contribute to DLCL development.

A more precise definition of the role of BCL-6 in normal and neoplastic B-cell development is the goal of ongoing study of transgenic mice engineered either to express BCL-6 under heterologous promoters or lacking BCL-6 function due to targeted deletions.

In this report, we present data demonstrating that HIV LTR activation is not a general consequence of cellular DNA damage, but rather a process unique to specific genotoxic stimuli, and that it does not necessarily depend on activation of NF-kappa B.

p60 phosphorylation was time and PMA dose dependent, and was induced by cell-permeable diacylglycerol, but not by inactive phorbol esters.

To investigate the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect on transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of IL-6 gene expression by IL-4 and IL-10, we studied IL-6 production, expression level of IL-6 mRNA, IL-6 promoter activity, transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB and NF-IL-6, and IL-6 mRNA stability in human monocytic cell lines, THP-1 and U937, stimulated by PMA and LPS in the absence or the presence of IL-4 or IL-10.

In chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays, utilizing the transient transfection of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid containing the IL-6 gene promoter, IL-4, but not IL-10, suppressed the transcriptional activity of the IL-6 gene promoter stimulated by PMA and LPS.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that IL-4, but not IL-10, inhibited nuclear NF-kappaB activity, and that IL-4 and IL-10 did not affect NF-IL-6 activity.

These results suggest that IL-4 may inhibit the transcription of the IL-6 gene by affecting NF-kappaB binding activity, while IL-10 may inhibit the IL-6 mRNA levels post-transcriptionally, without suppressing promoter activity.

In addition, IL-13 phosphorylated insulin response substrate-1, IL-4R p140, JAK1, and Tyk2, but not JAK3 kinase.

IL-4 also stimulated all three kinases and substrates, but unlike in immune cells, IL-4 did not involve JAK3 activation for its signaling in colon cancer cell lines.

Both IL-13 and IL-4 induced phosphorylation of IL-4 STAT (STAT6) but not STAT1, STAT3, or STAT5.

125I-IL-13 did not bind to colon cancer cell lines, but unlabeled IL-13 competed for the binding of 125I-IL-4.

IL-10 inhibited translocation of NF-kappaB in response to LPS but not the fungal stimuli.

Inactive calcineurin is unable to activate the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a transcription factor required for expression of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene.

however, alterations of NF kappa B did not correlate with changes in IL-2 expression.

In this work, we show that human peripheral blood T cells that are stimulated through the TCR and expanded with IL-2 are unresponsive to IFN-gamma, as determined by a lack of activation of jak kinases and the transcription factor, STAT1(alpha), a signal transducer and activator of transcription.

This nonresponsiveness occurs because of a lack of expression of the beta-chain (accessory factor) of the IFN-gamma receptor, while at the same time maintaining IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain expression.

When expressed in COS cells, however, NFAT1 is capable of transactivation, but it is not regulated correctly:

its subcellular localization and transcriptional function are not affected by stimulation of the COS cells with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

Thus, signaling in NK3.3 cells is not always identical with that in primary NK cells.

STAT1 alpha activation by IL-12 correlated with increased phosphorylation of serine, but not tyrosine.

The present results show that Jurkat T cells acutely exposed to micromolar concentrations of H2O2 exhibit substantial increases in AP-1 binding activity and the expression of c-jun but not c-fos mRNA.

The preferential induction of c-jun by H2O2 did not represent redox stabilization of mRNA transcripts, and oxidative signals closely resembled PHA/PMA stimulation by effectively transactivating the full length c-jun promoter via the proximal jun1 tumor promoter-responsive element ( TRE ) -like promoter element.

However, PHA/PMA but not oxidative signals induced the coordinate activation of reporter constructs containing the AP-1-TRE, NF-AT, and IL-2 promoter regions along with IL-2 mRNA expression.

Gel shift analysis revealed that oxidative suppression of NF-AT represented inhibition in the early generation of NFAT complexes rather than the binding of preformed NF-AT complexes.

As glucocorticoids regulate interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) production, we hypothesized that IFN alpha, a cytokine produced predominantly by monocytes in AIDS, should be increased in cortisol-resistant AIDS, attributing the lack of cortisol inhibition to IFN alpha production.

Therefore, we examined glucocorticoid receptor characteristics on monocytes by [3H]dexamethasone binding and measured IFN alpha, cortisol, and ACTH in AIDS patients with (AIDS-GR) or without glucocorticoid resistance (AIDS-C) and controls (C).

By contrast, glucocorticoids failed to inhibit IFNalpha production from AIDS-GR monocytes (approximately 20% inhibition).

In conclusion, elevated IFN alpha levels in AIDS-GR may be due to the lack of inhibitory effect of cortisol on IFN alpha production due to cortisol resistance in monocytes.

This activity is further inducible in activated T cells, but not in fibroblasts.

Together these results demonstrate that T cell expression of IL-3 is not specified by the activity of a single tissue-specific element, but instead involves multiple interacting elements that provide both specific positive regulation in T cells and specific negative regulation in fibroblasts.

The molecular background of the defects in the immune reactivity of human neonates has not been fully elucidated.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in ATRA-dependent growth inhibition and cellular differentiation are not presently understood.

ATRA did not activate nuclear factor kappa B or signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation pathways, suggesting that an alternate mechanism is involved in IRF-1 gene activation.

Finally, recombinant GHF-1 interacted directly with c-Jun but not c-Fos proteins.

NFAT1 possesses two transactivation domains whose sequences are not conserved in the other NFAT-family proteins, and a conserved DNA-binding domain that mediates the recruitment of cooperating nuclear transcription factors even when it is expressed in the absence of other regions of the protein.

PU.1 is completely absent from peripheral T cells and most T cell lines based on sensitive RT-PCR assays.

Gel-retardation experiments show that Spi-B can bind to all putative PU.1 binding sites, but do not reveal any preferred Spi-B binding site.

A 4- or 10-bp insertion between muE3 and muB inactivated the mu enhancer in S194 plasma cells but did not affect in vitro binding of Ets-1, PU.1, or the muE3-binding protein TFE3, alone or in pairwise combinations.

Circular permutation and phasing analyses demonstrated that PU.1 binding but not TFE3 or Ets-1 bends mu enhancer DNA toward the major groove.

Ectopic expression of the dominant negative C/EBP protein LIP inhibited HIV-1 mRNA and virus production in activated U1 cells, demonstrating that C/EBP proteins are required for provirus induction.

Here we report that human leukaemia cells carrying the translocation t(17;19) rapidly died by apoptosis when programmed to express a dominant-negative suppressor of the fusion protein E2A-HLF, indicating that the chimaeric oncoprotein probably affects cell survival rather than cell growth.

We questioned whether or not IL-10 and IL-4 affected the expression of transcription factors that are known to be involved in the control of the IL-6 transcription rate, namely activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor IL-6 (NF-IL6), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB).

Binding activity of NF-IL6 was also strongly inhibited by IL-4 whereas IL-10 showed no effect.

NF-IL6 mRNA levels were not affected by IL-10 or IL-4, suggesting that IL-4 affects binding activity of preexisting NF-IL6.

Neither IL-10 nor IL-4 inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappa B binding activity.

In agreement with this finding, Northern experiments where p65 and p105 mRNA levels were determined, demonstrated that expression of these components of the NF-kappa B transcription factor were not affected by IL-10 or IL-4.

Furthermore, neither IL-10 nor IL-4 showed any effect on I-kappa B mRNA expression as determined by Northern experiments.

cAMP inhibited the induction of expression of IL-2 receptor components, but did not inhibit IL-4 receptor alpha-chain and CD69 expression or the induction of activator protein 1 transcription factors.

Deletion of the glucocorticoid response elements located at ca. bp -850 upstream of Cp did not result in a significant loss in activity.

In contrast, neither E(gre) nor EA/S motifs contributed pronouncedly to Akv MLV transcription in NIH 3T3 cells lacking DNA-binding ALF1 or HEB and E2A proteins.

Moreover, ectopic Id1 repressed E(gre)-directed but not EA/S-directed MLV transcription in lymphoid cell lines.

Expression of dominant negative MAPKK-1 prevents NFAT induction.

Constitutively active MAPKK-1 fully activates ERK-2 and the transcription factor Elk-1, but does not substitute for activated p21ras and synergize with calcium/calcineurin signals to induce NFAT.

Expression of dominant negative N17Rac alsoprevents TCR and p21ras activation of NFAT, but without interfering with the ERK-2 pathway.

Activated Rac-1 could mimic activated p21ras to induce AP-1 but not to induce NFAT.

Moreover, the combination of activated MAPKK-1 and Rac-1 could not substitute for activated p21ras and synergize with calcium signals to induce NFAT.

Protein-tyrosine kinase activation is required for lipopolysaccharide induction of interleukin 1beta and NFkappaB activation, but not NFkappaB nuclear translocation.

Since recent studies have shown that lipopolysaccharide-induced tyrosine kinase activation is not required for NFkappaB nuclear translocation, we sought to determine whether NFkappaB translocated in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity was active in stimulating transcription.

Tyrosine kinases are not required for lipopolysaccharide-mediated nuclear translocation of NFkappaB.

However, in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity, the ability of NFkappaB to stimulate transcription is impaired.

in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity, AP-1-dependent transcription is enhanced.

These results suggest that, while lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of inflammatory mediators requires tyrosine kinase activity, tyrosine kinase activity is not obligatory for lipopolysaccharide signal transduction.

The primary and recurrent tumors in Group A did not show structural alterations in the p16, p15 or CDK4 genes, whereas homozygous codeletion of p16 and p15 was observed in both primary and recurrent tumors in Group B.

The extent to which peptides containing chemically and post-translationally modified amino acid side chains are recognized by primed CTL has not been clearly defined.

Similarly, CTL raised against the parent peptide did not recognize the succinimide derivative of this peptide.

Although NGFI-B/nur77 is essential for TCR-mediated apoptosis in T-cell hybridomas, the reports on nur77 knock-out mice and nur77 dominant negative transgenic mice suggest that there is a functional redundancy among NGFI-B/nur77 family.

Assuming that 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) inhibits TCR-mediated apoptosis, nur77 may cause apoptosis by monomer in the absence of 9-cis-RA and may inhibit apoptosis by heterodimer with RXR in the presence of 9-cis-RA.

Importantly, two previously characterized mutants with point mutations in Tax, M32 (Y196A, K197S) and M41 (H287A, P288S), which were shown to be defective in Tax-activated transcription were unable to interact with TFIIA in this assay.

We now report that vaccination with a CTL epitope derived from the human adenovirus type 5 E1A-region (Ad5E1A234-243), which can serve as a target for tumor-eradicating CTL, enhances rather than inhibits the growth of Ad5E1A-expressing tumors.

Ad5E1A-specific CTL activity could no longer be isolated from mice after injection of Ad5E1A-peptide, indicating that tolerization of Ad5E1A-specific CTL activity causes the enhanced tumor outgrowth.

This yields a fusion transcript, PML/RARalpha, a transcription factor with reported dominant negative functions in the absence of hormone.

Basal total white blood cell and granulocyte counts did not appreciably differ between PML/RARalpha transgenic and control mice.

Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and kit ligand cotreatment did not overcome this inhibition.

Anergic CD4+ Th cells do not produce IL-2 when challenged with Ag-pulsed accessory cells because of a transcriptional defect.

However, the reduced expression of these proteins was not the result of a global TCR/CD3-signaling defect because CD3 cross-linking induced an equivalent increase in intracellular-free calcium ions, as well as NFATp dephosphorylation, translocation to the nucleus, and DNA binding in both normal and anergic T cells.

Elevated cAMP did not prevent nuclear translocation of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers, decrease nuclear translocation of p65, or significantly modify TNFalpha-induced phosphorylation of p65.

However, NFATc.beta neither bound to the kappa3 element (an NFAT-binding site) in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter nor activated the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter in cotransfection assays.

By using 70Z/3-derived pre-B-cell lines either lacking or expressing human CD14 (the LPS receptor), it was observed that expression of human CD14 imparted responsiveness to LPS but not to OspA or spirochetal lipopeptides (assessed by induction of NF-kappa B and expression of surface immunoglobulin M).

A dramatic increase in the intracellular levels of NF-kappaB subunits c-Rel and NF-kappaB2 p100 and a moderate increase in NF-kappaB2 p52 and RelA(p65) were detected in HIV-1-infected cells, whereas NF-kappaB1 p105/p50 levels were not altered relative to the levels in uninfected cells.

Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that all seven EBV-positive tumour tissues constitutively expressed EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) 1 mRNA, but not EBNA2 mRNA.

by contrast, both Cp and Wp were silent, thus resulting in the lack of EBNA2 mRNA.

however, neither LMP1 nor LMP2B mRNA was detected in any of the tumours tested.

BZLF1 mRNA and the product, an immediate-early gene for EBV replication, was not expressed in any of them, thereby suggesting that the tumour cells carried EBV genomes in a tightly latent form.

An amino-terminal fragment of OCA-B binds the octamer site in the absence of a POU domain with the same sequence specificity.

Southern blot analysis showed rearrangement of BCL6, JH, and TCR beta but not of TCR delta.

In contrast, a cysteine protease inhibitor that also blocks apoptosis had no substantial affect upon cytokine production.

In contrast, ligand activation of c-Kit was unable to induce any of these effects in the same cells.

Activation of the erythropoietin receptor caused specific DNA-binding of Stat 5b, but failed to induce reporter gene transcription.

IL13 is unable to activate JAK1 and JAK3.

The Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins function as negative regulators of DNA binding, basic helix-loop-helix proteins in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.

Multifactor cis-dominant negative regulation of IL-2 gene expression in anergized T cells.

The molecular mechanism underlying IL-2 transcriptional blockade in anergic T cell clones is not fully understood.

To examine whether an active negative regulatory process occurs, we created a reporter construct containing as an enhancer four copies of the NF-AT site and one copy of the octamer site (4X NF-AT-Oct).

Addition of the -176 to -96 sequence to the 4X NF-AT-Oct construct did not impart the ability to be affected by anergy, but addition of the -236 to -96 sequence did, demonstrating that anergy is an active inhibitory process and that more than the presence of the -150 AP-1 binding site (-152 to -147) is required to mediate the effect.

Because the -180 site is not required for trans-activation, it was possible to confirm by mutation in the normal mouse IL-2 enhancer that this site is absolutely essential for anergy induction.

The simplest model to explain these results is that anergy is mediated by a complex of multiple transcription factors that exert a cis-acting dominant negative regulatory effect on the trans-activation of the IL-2 gene.

Stepwise deletions into the proximal promoter also revealed that the CBF site, but not the YY-1 site, was required for efficient induction of transcriptional activation.

This abnormality was not seen in resting T cells nor T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or SS accompanied by RA.

Furthermore both childrens ' T cells were unable to produce the cytokines IL-2, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).

This multiple cytokine production deficiency could not be restored by IL-2 or co-stimulatory signals provided by antigen-presenting cells (APC).

Moreover, mRNA for IL-2 and IFN-gamma could not be detected.

To determine whether the functional defect of the patients ' T cells was due to the absence or abnormal binding of transcription factors involved in cytokine gene expression, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to examine the DNA binding of AP-1, Oct, CREB, SP1, NF-kappa B and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) to their respective response elements in the promoter of the IL-2 gene.

Mature human lymphocytes are unique targets of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25(OH)2D3) in that vitamin D receptors (VDR) are not constitutively expressed, and specific cellular activation signals are required for both the up-regulation of VDR and establishment of reactivity to the lipophilic ligand.

Treatment of B lymphocytes with the cytokine IL-4 (IL-4), in the absence of prior activation, induces a weak up-regulation of VDR expression but fails to generate vitamin D-responsive element ( VDRE ) -reactive nuclear protein complexes or to initiate the genomic transcription of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase.

However, this apparent lack of response to the secosterol can be overcome by stimulation of B lymphocytes with a combination of these cellular activation signals, which are sufficient to lead to G1 cell cycle progression.

In A20 B cells, the TNF-alpha gene is not regulated by NFATp bound to the kappa 3 element.

Changes of any cysteine residue of the hRAR alpha-LBD had no significant influence on the binding of all-trans RA or 9-cis RA.

For all other arginine mutations, no differences in affinity were detectable.

The two mutations R217A and R294A caused an increased binding efficiency for antagonists but no change in agonist binding.

The phosphorylation of CREB that results in activation is mediated by protein kinase C rather than by protein kinase A.

Importantly, culture of MM cells with RB antisense, but not RB sense, oligonucleotide (ODN) triggered IL-6 secretion and proliferation in MM cells;

Although CD40 ligand (CD40L) triggers a shift from dephosphorylated to phosphorylated pRB and proliferation of B cells, the addition of exogenous IL-6 to CD40L-treated B cells does not alter either pRB or proliferation, as observed in MM cells.

The activation of JNK by classical T cell stimuli was transient, whereas that mediated by PDTC and butylated hydroxyanisole (but not N-acetylcysteine) was sustained.

In addition, JNK activation by PMA plus ionophore was sensitive to inhibitors of signaling pathways involving Ca2+, protein kinase C, and tyrosine phosphorylation, which failed to inhibit the activation mediated by PDTC.

Transfection of trans-dominant negative expression vectors of ras and raf, together with AP-1-dependent reporter constructs, as well as Western blot analysis using anti-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) antibodies, indicated that the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway did not appear to mediate the effect of the antioxidant.

E3 transcripts were RA-inducible in HL60 cells, but not in an RA-resistant subclone, HL60R, that harbors a mutated RAR alpha gene.

E3 transcripts are present in the myeloid, B-lymphoid, and erythroid lineages, absent in nonhematopoietic cells, and encode a highly hydrophobic, potentially phosphorylated polypeptide of unknown function with significant homology to a putative protein expressed in myeloid cells.

To further reduce the size of the common deleted region we have searched for small deletions or mitotic recombination events, neither of which would be detected by conventional cytogenetics.

In each case, cytogenetic analysis had either failed or had shown no abnormalities of chromosome 20.

No instance of microsatellite instability was observed in a total of 880 comparisons of granulocyte and T-cell DNA.

Loss of heterozygosity in PB granulocytes would be masked by the presence of significant numbers of normal granulocytes not derived from the malignant clone.

These results show that , in the vast majority of patients presented here, the failure to detect loss of heterozygosity can not be attributed to the presence of normal polyclonal granulocytes.

Our results therefore show that allele loss on chromosome 20q in polycythemia vera does not commonly involve mitotic recombination or chromosome loss and that microsatellite instability is a rare event in this disorder.

However, more recent studies in human T cell lines have suggested that the N-terminal domain is not necessary for steroid-regulated apoptosis and that GR-mediated transrepression may be the more critical mechanism.

To better understand the contribution of the GR N-terminal transactivation domain in mediating murine thymocyte apoptosis, we stably transfected GR, GR variants, and the androgen receptor (AR) into receptor-negative S49 murine thymoma cells.

Taken together, these results support our conclusion that transcriptional transactivation is a necessary signaling component of S49 cell apoptosis, although an additional role for GR-mediated transrepression cannot be excluded.

Suppression of c-jun by antisense oligonucleotides inhibits cell adhesion but not respiratory burst during phorbol ester-induced differentiation of U937 human monoblastic cells.

the C-JUN AS oligonucleotides inhibited cell adhesion, whereas they did not affect another marker of differentiation, respiratory burst (measured by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay).

These results suggest a critical role of c-jun in both cell proliferation and PMA-induced cell adhesion but not in PMA-induced respiratory burst in U937 cells.

Here, we report that differentiated B cells contain a novel substoichiometric TAF of 105 kDa not found associated with TFIID isolated from other cell types.

No glucocorticoid recognition sequences are present in this promoter region and dexamethasone is still able to repress transcription when the multimerized NF-kappa B sequence is transactivated by TNF-alpha upon transfection in 293 cells.

The proliferative responses of purified CD4+ or CD8+ T cells are suppressed more strongly by TPCK when anti-CD28 rather than the phorbol ester PMA is used as the mitogenic coactivator.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we find that TPCK virtually abolishes (to less than 1%) the levels of NF(kappa)B (but not Oct-1) found in nuclear and whole cell extracts of activated T cells.

NAC not only blocks the effect of TPCK but enhances mitogenesis and cytokine production (&gt; 2.5-fold in some cases) upon activation of unsuppressed T cells.

IL-12-induced activation of NK and T cells occurs in the absence of immediate-early activation gene expression.

Using reverse-transcription PCR differential display, we isolated an mRNA species expressed in IL-2- but not IL-12-stimulated NK cells.

This was identified as the mRNA encoding the transcription factor egr-1, which is expressed with fast kinetics in T and NK cells upon IL-2, but not IL-12, stimulation.

Analysis of the accumulation of mRNA-encoding members of the AP-1 transcription factor family demonstrated that c-fos and junB are also expressed upon stimulation of NK and T cells with IL-2, but not IL-12, whereas expression of c-jun and junD is not modified by either cytokine.

Our data provide the first demonstration that IL-12-mediated activation of T and NK cells does not involve expression of members of the immediate-early activation genes family (egr-1, c-fos, and junB), AP-1 transcriptional activity, or bcl-2 expression.

Furthermore, in the absence of exogenous HGFs, FL monocytic progenitors (colony-forming unit monocyte [CFU-M]) generate large colonies exclusively composed of monocytes-macrophages;

these colonies are absent in FCS- clonogenic culture.

Studies on unicellular and paired daughter cell culture unequivocally indicate that the shift is mediated by modulation of the HPC differentiation program to the granulopoietic pathway (rather than RA-induced down-modulation of multipotent/erythroid/monocytic HPC growth coupled with recruitment of granulocytic HPCs).

It is crucial that these results mirror recent observations indicating that murine adult HPCs transduced with dominant negative ATRA receptor (RAR) gene are immortalized and show a selective blockade of granulocytic differentiation.

In contrast, neither the RA-stimulated, RARE-mediated transcription nor the induced RAR-beta expression was suppressed by VitD3, suggesting that VitD3 selectively inhibited the retinoid-induced differentiation program but not the RARE-mediated signal.

Pb-induced activation of NF-kappa B is blocked by antibodies for p65 and p50 subunits but not cRel, indicating that the p65:p50 heterodimer (NF-kappa B) is involved.

Pb did not activate NF-kappa B in 4 different T cell lines, suggesting that lymphoid cell lines may not be reliable surrogates for the study of transcriptional activation in human T cells.

These results suggest that p2l(ras) is an essential mediator in generating not only positive but also negative modulatory mechanisms controlling the competence of T cells in response to inductive stimulations.

The catalytic domain of pp56(lck), but not its regulatory domain, is sufficient for inducing IL-2 production.

Two pp56(lck) mutants lacking either the entire catalytic domain or the entire NH2 regulatory domain were generated, and their abilities to trigger transactivation of the TCR-regulated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) region of the IL-2 promoter were compared.

Only the catalytic, but not the NH2 regulatory, domain of pp56(lck) was able to induce NF-AT region transactivation on its own and to cooperate with other intracellular signals to trigger this response.

Induction of fra-1 following engagement of CD40 did not require protein synthesis, suggesting that the PKC-dependent linkage between CD40 and fra-1 is direct.

Overexpression of Bcl-2 in tumor cells blocks apoptosis induced by many stimuli, but inhibition of Fas-mediated killing has not been consistently observed.

Transient overexpression of Bcl-2 in mouse and human T cell blasts did not block Fas-mediated apoptosis, whereas etoposide- and glucocorticoid-induced cytotoxicity was potently inhibited.

Expression of Bcl-xL and adenovirus E1B 19K did not interfere with anti-Fas killing.

The last 13 amino acids containing a PXQXT/S sequence are highly conserved in human and simian EBV LMP1 but do not bind TRAF3, suggesting a distinct role for this conserved region of LMP1.

Here we report that sustained high concentrations of Ca2+, but not transient pulses, are required to maintain NF-AT transcription factors in the nucleus, where they participate in Ca2+-dependent induction of genes required for lymphocyte activation and proliferation.

Furthermore, overexpression and constitutive nuclear localization of NF-AT, but not Jun, Fos, NF-kappaB, Oct or Ets family members, renders the interleukin-2 enhancer in Jurkat T lymphocytes resistant to FK506 and cyclosporin A.

However, IFN(alpha) does not have any effects on the retinoid-dependent regulation of the myeloid surface markers CD11b and CD33.

The IFN-dependent increase in RAR(alpha) levels and the enhancing effect of the cytokine on retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers expression may be a characteristic of PML-RAR positive cells, since the phenomena are not observed in HL-60 promyelocytes.

Interferons as well as retinoids inhibit the growth of NB4 cells, although the 2 classes of compounds do not significantly interact in terms of anti-proliferative activity.

We demonstrate that although the individual components of this element do not respond to IL-2, together they form a composite element capable of conferring IL-2 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter.

Thus, IL-2-induced IL-2R alpha promoter activity requires a complex upstream element, which appears to contain binding sites for both positive and negative regulatory factors.

The nature of CD40-dependent signals in proliferating fresh human Epstein-Barr virus-negative B lymphocytes is currently unknown.

The use of the protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK )-specific inhibitor herbimycin A dramatically decreased cellular proliferation without altering the activity of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeat (HIV-1 LTR), a promoter largely dependent on the binding of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B).

In contrast, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase specific inhibitor H-89 totally inhibited HIV-1 LTR activity at a concentration as low as 100 nM without affecting cellular proliferation.

While PKC depletion did not alter the NF-kappa B level, treatment of B lymphocytes with H-89 or herbimycin A provoked a decrease in the NF-kappa B level.

Active suppression of the class II transactivator-encoding AIR-1 locus is responsible for the lack of major histocompatibility complex class II gene expression observed during differentiation from B cells to plasma cells.

Class II molecules are not expressed in plasma cells because of an active suppression resulting in the abrogation of class II gene transcription.

We show here that the plasma cell-specific repressor function, designated SIR (suppressor of immune response genes), does not act directly on the transcription of class II genes, but instead on the transcription of the AIR-1 gene, whose product, the class II transactivator (CIITA), is fundamental for the regulation of the constitutive and inducible expression of MHC class II genes.

This was unambiguously demonstrated by the fact that plasmacytoma x B cell hybrids carrying an AIR-1 locus derived from CIITA-expressing cells do not express CIITA-specific transcripts.

Interestingly, in CIITA-transfected cell hybrids, cell surface expression of the human HLA-DQ heterodimer was not observed.

This result was not attributable to lack of HLA-DQ alpha or -DQ beta transcription, because both transcripts were present in the CIITA-transfected hybrids, although at reduced levels.

Lobular or mucinous samples showed few or no alterations, whereas most ductal samples had high chromosome 1 polysomy with under-representation of 1p36.

No correlation between chromosome 1 alterations and nuclear grade, age, size, lymph-node involvement, hormonal receptor presence, proliferation activity or p53 protein expression was detected.

Silencing of human fetal globin expression is impaired in the absence of the adult beta-globin gene activator protein EKLF.

We find that in the absence of EKLF, while human beta-globin expression is dramatically reduced, gamma-globin transcripts are elevated approximately 5-fold.

Our findings are compatible with a competitive model of switching in which EKLF mediates an adult stage-specific interaction between the beta-globin gene promoter and the locus control region that excludes the gamma-globin gene.

it had no effect on IL-10 secretion.

Thus, stress may cause a selective suppression of TH1 functions and a shift toward a TH2 cytokine pattern rather than generalized TH suppression.

RT-PCR demonstrated that NL of both subtypes expressed EBNAI of the QUK splice pattern, the latent membrane proteins, LMP1 and 2 and the BamHI A rightward transcripts in the absence of EBNA2 mRNAs, compatible with the latency type II pattern.

Although 2 early lytic transcripts, BZLF1 and BHRF1, were also detected in 13 and 10 cases, respectively, the lack of ZEBRA staining in any case indicates that these lytic transcripts are most likely expressed by rare cells in the biopsies entering lytic cycle.

Lack of IL-12 signaling in human allergen-specific Th2 cells.

The majority of these TCC exhibited a strongly polarized Th2 cytokine profile, and the production of IFN-gamma could not be induced by exogenous IL-12.

Only those TCC with low IFN-gamma levels in the absence of IL-12 responded to IL-12 by additional enhancement of IFN-gamma production.

The IL-12 nonresponsiveness of the Th2 clones was further evident by the total lack of IL-12-induced phosphorylation of STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-4), a transcription factor that is typically involved in IL-12 signaling.

Consequently, IL-12 also failed to induce the DNA-binding activity of STAT4-containing complexes in the nuclei of these Th2 clones.

Our results indicate that human allergen-specific Th cells with strongly polarized Th2 cytokine profiles do not respond to IL-12 and , therefore , can not be induced to produce IFN-gamma.

Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5.

Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system.

In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation.

These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine.

High levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes, but not other human tissues.

however, it has not been established whether the expression has a causal role in oncogenesis.

The magnitude and kinetics of intracellular ROI were similar, suggesting that there were no differences in ROI-forming mechanisms or antioxidative capacities.

Moreover, ZK161422, but not ZK157202, showed preference for gene activation from a promoter carrying a VD response element with a palindromic arrangement of two hexameric receptor binding sites spaced by 9 nucleotides (IP9) rather than for activation from a response element formed by a direct repeat spaced by 3 nucleotides (DR3).

We report here that PML is expressed at low levels or not expressed in normal circulating human monocytes, lymphocytes, and polymorphonucleate cells, but is markedly induced by interferon; that PML and PML/RAR alpha expression is augmented by interferon in the NB4 APL cell line, which carries the t(15;17), and in APL blasts from patients; that interferon inhibits growth and survival of NB4 APL cells in cooperation with RA; that interferons alone have minimal maturation effect on NB4 cells; and , finally, that interferon gamma, but not alpha or beta, induces maturation and growth suppression of NB4 cells with de novo retinoid resistance, and partially restores RA response.

However, in vivo, not only CSF but also many other cytokines are produced under various conditions.

However, the monocyte-derived DC were not terminally differentiated cells;

In contrast to IL-4, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) had no demonstrable effect on the differentiation of monocytes.

Taken together, these results provide a new aspect to our knowledge of monocyte differentiation and provide evidence that human monocytes are flexible in their differentiation potential and are precursors not only of macrophages but also of CD1+relB+DC and TRAP-positive MGC.

Implication of viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis has been suspected on the basis of several indirect observations, but thus far, a direct link between EBV and rheumatoid arthritis has not been provided.

Recently, it has been shown that RelB knockout mice have no dendritic cells (DC).

In germinal centers GC, p50, p52, and RelB were found in the nuclei of FDC only and were not detected in the nuclei of CD68+ cells.

Cells with nuclear p50 were negative for the CD38, CD20 and CD2 markers.

These results show that , physiologically, high levels of nuclear of p50, p52 and RelB are restricted to accessory cells of the immune system, which include FDC in GC, and DC and macrophages in the T cell zone, that specialized scavenger macrophages from GC do not have detectable levels of p52 and RelB, whereas macrophages from the T cell area, known to present the antigen to T cells, do have both nuclear p52 and RelB, and that in the T cell zone, p52 and RelB are located in nuclei of both CD1a+, CD68+ or both, cells APC, whereas p50 is restricted to CD1a- and CD68- APC.

The protein from E. coli specifically converted dUTP to dUMP and did not react with other dNTPs or NTPs.

While the sera of EBV-negative individuals (0/3) or healthy carriers (0/33) did not contain detectable levels of antibodies, patients with mononucleosis (5/18), chronic EBV infection (2/7), EBV reactivation (7/20) and human immunodeficiency virus infection (5/24) showed elevated antibody titres against the enzyme.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrated that a short treatment of human T lymphocytes with PGE2 induces specific binding activity to CRE and AP-2, but not AP-1, DNA elements.

The Oct-2 transcription factor is a member of the POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) family of transcription factors and is expressed only in B lymphocytes and in neuronal cells but not in other cell types.

Visceral TSC2 expression was comparable in autopsy tissues from patients with and without TSC;

In the erythroleukemia cell line K562, due to the absence of Spi-B, only PU.1 bound to the Btk promoter.

However, mutation of the PU box had no effect in the T-cell line Jurkat, where none of the Spi-1 family members is expressed.

In fetal liver of PU.1-/- mice, which lack lymphoid and myeloid cells, expression of Btk was reduced two- to threefold but not abolished.

However, none of these proximal regions account for the induction of IL-2R alpha transcription by IL-2.

The negative effects of point mutations in the LMP1(1-231) core TRAF binding motif on TRAF binding and NF-kappaB activation genetically link the TRAFs to LMP1(1-231)-mediated NF-kappaB activation.

NF-kappaB activation by LMP1(1-231) is likely to be mediated by TRAF1/TRAF2 heteroaggregates since TRAF1 is unique among the TRAFs in coactivating NF-kappaB with LMP1(1-231), a TRAF2 dominant-negative mutant can block LMP1(1-231)-mediated NF-kappaB activation as well as TRAF1 coactivation, and 30 % of TRAF2 is associated with TRAF1 in EBV-transformed B cells.

TRAF3 is a negative modulator of LMP1(1-231)-mediated NF-kappaB activation.

Surprisingly, TRAF1, -2, or -3 does not interact with the terminal LMP1 CT aa 333 to 386 which can independently mediate NF-kappaB activation.

CD40, but not lipopolysaccharide and anti-IgM stimulation of primary B lymphocytes, leads to a persistent nuclear accumulation of RelB.

LPS stimulation did not give rise to a persistent nuclear accumulation of RelB and c-Rel, whereas nuclear c-Rel, but not RelB, accumulated after B cell receptor stimulation.

CD40 induced not only nuclear translocation but also de novo synthesis of RelB RNA and protein.

S107 plasmacytoma cells, which express CD40 but are defective for the nuclear appearance of p50/p65-NF-kappaB, do not express RelB after CD40 stimulation.

Since LPS and anti-IgM were unable to activate RelB, CD40 appears to trigger a special program of gene expression involved in the proliferation and/or differentiation of B lymphocytes.

Consequently, the present study was addressed to understand this phenomenon and revealed the existence of a unique 47 kDa protein factor having affinity for this SRE sequence in lymphocytes from normal subjects as well as its absence in lymphocytes from untreated CML patients.

Ara-C activated SMase with 10 minutes in both Jurkat and EL4 cells, while phorbol ester (PMA) had no effect.

PMA, but not Ara-C or ceramides, activated ERK MAPKS, in Jurkat and EL4.

Thus, ceramide is not a positive signal for ERK activation in T-cell lines.

In this paper we have investigated the role of Egr-1 in B cell growth regulation by examining the gene expression in a panel of B cell lines, including both EBV genome negative and EBV carrying cell lines.

The CpG dinucleotide in this element is selectively methylated in Th2 T cells and other cells that do not express IFN-gamma, and methylation markedly reduces transcription factor binding.

Contrary to the idea that protein kinase C is involved in TCR-mediated activation of NF-kappaB, high doses of staurosporine did not interfere with activation of NF-kappaB by PHA, while the same dose of staurosporine completely blocked activation by PMA.

PHA-induced kappaB-dependent reporter activity was , however, effectively blocked by a dominant negative form of Raf-1, suggesting a critical role for a Raf kinase.

To help elucidate further the mechanism by which ZAP-70 regulates these initial events, we used a dominant-negative mutant approach.

This result demonstrates that Tyr-492 and Tyr-493 are not responsible for the Src homology domain 2-mediated association of p56(lck) with ZAP-70.

Lymphocytes from CML patients lack a 47 kDa factor having affinity for a genomic sterol regulatory sequence.

Since the human genomic sterol regulatory element (SRE) has been shown to regulate various key genes involved in this phenomenon, the present study revealed the existence of a unique 47 kDa protein factor having affinity for this SRE sequence in lymphocytes from normal subjects, as well as its absence in lymphocytes from untreated CML patients.

The SCMV SNE sites contain potential overlapping core recognition binding motifs for SRF, Rel/NFkappaB, ETS, and YY1 class transcription factors but fail to respond to either serum or tumor necrosis factor alpha.

Unlike classical NFkappaB sites, neither the SNE nor the SEE motif responded to phosphatase inhibition by okadaic acid.

A 40-fold stimulation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity mediated by four tandem repeats of the SNE could be induced within 2 h ( and up to 250-fold within 6 h) after addition of TPA in DNA-transfected U-937 cells, indicating that the stimulation appeared likely to be a true protein kinase C-mediated signal transduction event rather than a differentiation response.

We find that , although the variant octamer motif binds Oct-1 and Oct-2 in vitro with 5-fold lower affinity than the consensus octamer motif, mutation of the variant octamer motif to either a consensus octamer or non-octamer motif has no effect on transcriptional activation from the germline promoter.

The promoter region lacked a TATA box but contained potential binding sites for the transcriptional factors including two Sp1, CRE, Myb and NFkB located at positions -153, -178, -286, -875, and -1011, respectively.

Inhibition of RANTES expression did not appear to be secondary to IL-2 inhibition and required binding to the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor.

Although inhibition of IL-4-driven germline C epsilon transcription by NAC was not sufficient, the agent remarkably diminished anti-CD40 mAb-mediated up-regulation of germline C epsilon transcription.

However, NAC did not significantly affect the spontaneous production of IgE by atopic B cells.

The purpose of this review is to show how the accumulation of various biochemical lesions with advancing age leads to the failure of a critical cell function, namely the activation-induced lymphocyte proliferation.

They fail to induce mRNA of TNF-alpha after 3 h of culture.

The kinetics of expression suggest that the high initial levels are caused by the isolation procedure, and do not reflect constitutive expression.

Although JAK3 is required for proper lymphoid development, the precise roles of this kinase in IL-2 and IL-4 signaling in lymphocytes have not been defined.

Here, we have studied IL-2 and IL-4 signaling in B cell lines lacking JAK3.

Although IL-2-induced phosphorylation of IL-2R beta, JAK1, and STAT5 all required the presence of JAK3, IL-4-mediated phosphorylation of JAK1, STAT6, and insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 did not.

These data indicate that IL-4 signaling occurs in the absence of of JAK3, but is comparatively inefficient.

Transfection of an expression vector containing ORF2 but not full length cDNA was able to transform NIH3T3 cells and induce tumors in nude mice.

Within the PBL, Bcd gene expression was restricted to CD19+ B-cells and absent from CD14+ monocytes and T-cells.

Bcd transcripts were detected in all normal PBL samples tested but not in several malignant human B-cell lines and not in 50 % of B-cells from B-CLL patients.

Its immunosuppressive property is distinct from cyclosporin because only tepoxalin, but not cyclosporin, suppresses NF-kappa B activation.

No difference in plasma cortisol was found between the patients and the healthy subjects (P &gt; 0.05).

These results indicate that the function of adrenal cortex may be improved by the compensation mechanism of the patients, but the lower GCR number was the result of lacking of oxygen in the patients.

However, the nature of the subunit involved in this mechanism has not been defined.

High doses of sodium salicylate suppressed NF-kappa B p65 mRNA accumulation, resulting in suppression of total NF-kappa B, p50 on tissue oligonucleotide had no effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappa B activation.

Lack of T-cell-mediated recognition of the fusion region of the pml/RAR-alpha hybrid protein by lymphocytes of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients.

The in vitro immunization of peripheral blood lymphocytes from four patients in remission (S.R., F.R., M.M., P. G.) with BCR1/25, a 25-mer pml/RAR-alpha, did not elicit either a polyclonal or a clonal immune response specific to the peptide.

APL blasts, available only from patients F.R. and P.G., were not lysed by C3/5 and were unable to present peptide BCR1/25.

Incubation of APL cells with IFN-gamma failed to induce HLA class II molecules and recognition by the C3/5 clone.

Since APL cells do not express HLA class II molecules, we tested in two donors (D.E. and C.H.R.) and in patients S.R.and P.G.whether the use of 9-mer peptides (BCR1/9) would generate a CD8/HLA class I-restricted response.

No peptide-specific T-cell line or clone could be generated from both donors and patients.

5-LOX and 5-LOX activating protein (FLAP) are coexpressed in lymphoid cells but not in monocytic or epithelial cells.

IL-1beta stimulation of epithelial cells did not generate any ROIs and NF-kappaB induction was not influenced by 5-LOX inhibitors.

This pathway involves the Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases, two enzymes which are not required for NF-kappaB activation by IL-1beta in epithelial cells.

The first intron acted as a strong transcriptional activator in a position-dependent manner and with no cell-type specificity.

Patients with diabetic nephropathy showed higher NF-kappaB binding activity in Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and stronger immunohistological staining for activated NF-kappaBp65 than patients without renal complications.

When we analyzed the nature of STAT proteins capable of binding to IL-2Ralpha, pim-1, and IRF-1 GAS elements after cytokine stimulation, we observed IFN-alpha-induced binding of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT4, but not STAT5 to all of these elements.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced HIV-1 replication in OM10.1 or Ach2 cells was significantly inhibited by non-cytotoxic doses of AuTG (&gt;10 microM in OM10.1 cells and &gt;25 F.M in Ach2 cells), while 25 microM of the counter-anion thioglucose (TG) or gold compound containing divalent gold ion, HAuCl3, had no effect.

The molecular basis for increased IL-4 gene expression in atopy is not fully understood.

At the most proximal P0 site, NFAT-containing complexes devoid of NFAT2 were readily inducible in the Th1 clones, but hardly or  not in the Th2 clones.

In contrast, both in Th1 and Th2 clones NFAT-containing complexes were strongly inducible at the P1 site, consisting of NFAT2 and a P0-compatible NFAT activity, without apparent differences between Th1 and Th2 clones.

Like in Th2 clones, suppressed NFAT-P0 complex formation was observed also at the polyclonal level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of three of five severe atopic dermatitis patients with strongly elevated serum IgE levels, but not in control PBMC.

The inhibitory effects of NAC were not due to nonspecific toxicity as neither the viability of DC nor their mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis were modified by NAC.

Finally, we found that the addition of NAC to MLR between naive T cells and allogeneic DC resulted in a profound inhibition of alloreactive responses, which could be attributed to a defect of DC as APC-independent T cell responses were not inhibited by NAC.

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated immune responses, including activation of monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells, play an important role in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative bacteria-induced sepsis syndrome.

In transient cotransfection experiments, dominant negative mutants of the IL-1 signaling pathway, including MyD88, IRAK, IRAK2, and TRAF6 inhibited both IL-1- and LPS-induced NF-kappaB-luciferase activity.

LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation was not inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2 that is involved in TNF signaling.

LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene was not inhibited by IL-1 receptor antagonist.

However, the mechanism by which IFNs mediate this inhibition has not been defined.

The ability of type I and type II IFNs to inhibit IL-4/IL-13-induced STAT6 activity is dose- and time-dependent, and is not unique to monocytes because IFNs induce the same effects in fibroblasts.

Inhibition of STAT6 activity is not evident unless cells are preincubated with IFN for at least 1 h before IL-4 stimulation.

The results of supershift analysis using specific antibodies against transcription factors suggested that both binding complexes contained the NF-kappaB components p50 and p65, and did not contain other NF-kappaB proteins (p52, c-Rel, Rel B), AP-1 proteins (c-Fos, C-Jun), CREB or C/EBPbeta (NF-IL6).

Furthermore, CoCl2 also caused time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase isoform ERK2 without significantly affecting ERK1, indicating ERK2 is the preferred substrate for upstream kinase of the MAPK pathway.

Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers for 6 hours with 0.2 mmol/L diamide and 1 mmol/L buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) decreased GSH levels and increased the ratio of GSSG to GSH without cell toxicity.

Interestingly, phase 1 adhesion was inversely correlated with GSH levels but not with the GSSG/GSH ratio, whereas phase 2 neutrophil adhesion was positively correlated with GSSG/GSH ratio but not with GSH levels.

Examination of activation-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha did not demonstrate any significant age-related alterations.

These results suggest that a decline in proteasome activity results in a failure to fully degrade IkappaBalpha in the elderly.

This failure to degrade IkappaBalpha may underlie both the observed decrease in NFkappaB induction and the IL-2 receptor expression in TNF-treated T cells during aging.

In CAT reporter constructions no appreciable level of CAT activity was supported by the beta globin promoter, and only low level activity by the delta promoter.

Coupling of the upstream beta globin sequence from approximately -500 to -250 bp to the truncated delta promoter fragment led to complete extinction of transcription activity, consistent with a negative regulatory effect of the beta globin gene upstream element(s).

The signal cascade transducing this effect is not yet clear.

In contrast, gp41 failed to stimulate NF-kappaB binding activity in as much as no NF-kappaB bound to the main NF-kappaB-binding site 2 of the IL-10 promoter after addition of gp41.

Specific inhibitors of p70(S6)-kinase (rapamycin), and Gi protein (pertussis toxin), prevented induction of IL-10 production by gp41 in monocytes, while inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (wortmannin) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (PD 98059) did not.

Thus HIV-1 gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation in monocytes may not involve NF-kappaB, MAPK, or PI 3-kinase activation, but rather may operate through activation of adenylate cyclase and pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi/Go protein to effect p70(S6)-kinase activation.

However, the sensitivity of cells to these agents is not merely governed by the expression of their receptors and the availability of ligand to bind them.

Neither cell population generated significant amounts of E2 from E1.

However, the HTLV-I genes including Tax are not expressed significantly in primary leukemic cells from ATL patients.

One T-cell line derived from ATL leukemic cells, TL-Om1, displayed constitutive NF-kappaB activity, as well as enhanced degradation of IkappaBalpha, despite the lack of detectable Tax expression.

The CD34+ myelomonocytic cell line KG1 differentiates into dendritic-like cells in response to granulocyte-macrophage CSF plus TNF-alpha, or PMA (with or without the calcium ionophore ionomycin, or TNF-alpha), with different stimuli mediating different aspects of the process.

IL-2-mediated cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis does not require NF-kappa B or activating protein-1 activation in primary human T cells.

IL-2 is required not only for cell cycle progression but also to protect Ag-activated T cells from programmed cell death.

The current study clearly demonstrates that IL-2 does not induce I kappa B alpha degradation or NF-kappa B activation in primary human T cells that respond to IL-2 by entering the cell cycle and avoiding apoptosis.

Similarly, IL-2 neither activates JNK nor increases AP-1 binding activity to a consensus o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) response element.

These data show that neither NF-kappa B nor AP-1 activation is required for IL-2-mediated survival or cell cycle progression in activated primary human T cells.

Fetal thymocytes infected with adenovirus containing mut-I kappa B were found to develop normally until the CD44-CD25+, CD4-CD8- double-negative stage, while production of more mature double-positive and single-positive populations was strongly decreased.

In contrast, treatment of HL-60 cells with retinoic acid or DMSO, which results in a granulocytic differentiation of these cells, decreases 4E-BP1 amount without affecting its phosphorylation and strongly increases 4E-BP2 amount.

CD40 expression was confirmed in 7 human MM cell lines established from immunogenic primary tumors or metastases, whereas 11 cell lines established from advanced stages were CD40 negative.

CD40 expression could be enhanced in CD40-positive MM by stimulation with IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha but not by interleukin (IL)-1beta or CD40 triggering.

When two 4-trifluoromethyl salicylate derivatives [2-acetoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-benzoic acid (triflusal) and its deacetylated metabolite 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid (HTB)] were compared with aspirin and sodium salicylate as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, we observed that in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-activated human blood, triflusal, aspirin, and HTB, but not sodium salicylate, inhibited COX-2-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production (IC50 = 0.16, 0.18, 0.39, and &gt;10 mM, respectively).

To test this apparent discrepancy, we realized that HTB and triflusal (but neither aspirin nor salicylate) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of COX-2 protein expression in peripheral human mononuclear cells.

Unexpectedly, the presence of nuclear I(kappa)B(alpha) did not inhibit NF-kappaB binding to DNA and this phenomenon was not due to the presence of IkappaBbeta at the nuclear level.

Immunoprecipitation experiments failed to demonstrate an association between nuclear I(kappa)B(alpha) and NF-kappaB proteins.

Our results demonstrate that in resting and PMA-activated human PBL, I(kappa)B(alpha) is present in the nucleus in an apparently inactive form unable to disrupt NF-kappaB binding from DNA.

No evidence for inflammatory cytokine production was obtained under these conditions.

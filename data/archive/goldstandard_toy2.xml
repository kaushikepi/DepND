Binding of the drug inhibits isomerase activity, but studies with other prolyl isomerase inhibitors and analysis of cyclosporin-resistant mutants in yeast suggest that the effects of the drug result from the formation of an inhibitory complex between the drug and isomerase, and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> from inhibition of isomerase activity</SCOPE>.

A transcription factor, NF-AT, which is essential for early T-cell gene activation, seems to be a specific target of cyclosporin A and FK506 action because transcription directed by this protein is blocked in T cells treated with these drugs, with little or <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect</SCOPE> on other transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-kappa B.

In contrast, the insertion did contribute to the formation of caps in response to receptor cross-linking, consistent with suggestions that the lymphocyte but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> macrophage</SCOPE> form of the receptor can associate with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton.

While this expectation may be realized in some cases, we have <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> found evidence for it</SCOPE>.

In addition, LTB4 mediated transactivation of a heterologous promoter construct containing the NF-chi B or the NF-IL6 enhancer, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the AP-1 enhancer</SCOPE>.

The anti-oxidative effect of BHA was accompanied by an increase in thiol, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> glutathione</SCOPE>, content in stimulated and unstimulated T cell, whereas TNF stimulation itself barely modified the cellular thiol level.

However, this apparent <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of response to the secosterol</SCOPE> can be overcome by stimulation of B lymphocytes with a combination of these cellular activation signals, which are sufficient to lead to G1 cell cycle progression.

Importantly, culture of MM cells with RB antisense, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> RB sense</SCOPE>, oligonucleotide (ODN) triggered IL-6 secretion and proliferation in MM cells;

Although CD40 ligand (CD40L) triggers a shift from dephosphorylated to phosphorylated pRB and proliferation of B cells, the addition of exogenous IL-6 to CD40L-treated B cells does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> alter either pRB or proliferation</SCOPE>, as observed in MM cells.

The activation of JNK by classical T cell stimuli was transient, whereas that mediated by PDTC and butylated hydroxyanisole (but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> N-acetylcysteine</SCOPE>) was sustained.

In addition, JNK activation by PMA plus ionophore was sensitive to inhibitors of signaling pathways involving Ca2+, protein kinase C, and tyrosine phosphorylation, which <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to inhibit the activation mediated by PDTC</SCOPE>.

Transfection of trans-dominant negative expression vectors of ras and raf, together with AP-1-dependent reporter constructs, as well as Western blot analysis using anti-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) antibodies, indicated that <SCOPE>the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway did <NEG>not</NEG> appear to mediate the effect of the antioxidant</SCOPE>.

E3 transcripts were RA-inducible in HL60 cells, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in an RA-resistant subclone, HL60R, that harbors a mutated RAR alpha gene</SCOPE>.

The association of 20q deletions with myeloid " stem cell " disorders suggests that the deletions mark the site of one or more genes, <SCOPE><NEG>loss</NEG></SCOPE> or inactivation of which plays a role in the regulation of normal hematopoietic progenitors.

To further reduce the size of the common deleted region we have searched for small deletions or mitotic recombination events, <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> of which would be detected by conventional cytogenetics</SCOPE>.

In each case, cytogenetic analysis had either failed or had shown <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> abnormalities of chromosome 20</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> instance of microsatellite instability was observed in a total of 880 comparisons of granulocyte and T-cell DNA</SCOPE>.

Loss of heterozygosity in PB granulocytes would be masked by the presence of significant numbers of normal granulocytes <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> derived from the malignant clone</SCOPE>.

These results show that , in the vast majority of patients presented here, the <SCOPE><SCOPE><NEG>failure</NEG> to detect loss of heterozygosity</SCOPE> <NEG>can not</NEG> be attributed to the presence of normal polyclonal granulocytes</SCOPE>.

Our results therefore show that allele loss on chromosome 20q in polycythemia vera does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> commonly involve mitotic recombination or chromosome loss</SCOPE> and that microsatellite instability is a rare event in this disorder.

However, more recent studies in human T cell lines have suggested that the N-terminal domain is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> necessary for steroid-regulated apoptosis</SCOPE> and that GR-mediated transrepression may be the more critical mechanism.

Suppression of c-jun by antisense oligonucleotides inhibits cell adhesion but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> respiratory burst</SCOPE> during phorbol ester-induced differentiation of U937 human monoblastic cells.

the C-JUN AS oligonucleotides inhibited cell adhesion, whereas they did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect another marker of differentiation, respiratory burst (measured by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay)</SCOPE>.

These results suggest a critical role of c-jun in both cell proliferation and PMA-induced cell adhesion but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in PMA-induced respiratory burst in U937 cells</SCOPE>.

Here, we report that differentiated B cells contain a novel substoichiometric TAF of 105 kDa <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> found associated with TFIID isolated from other cell types</SCOPE>.

The proliferative responses of purified CD4+ or CD8+ T cells are suppressed more strongly by TPCK when anti-CD28 <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> the phorbol ester PMA</SCOPE> is used as the mitogenic coactivator.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we find that TPCK virtually abolishes (to less than 1%) the levels of NF(kappa)B (but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> Oct-1</SCOPE>) found in nuclear and whole cell extracts of activated T cells.

Using reverse-transcription PCR differential display, we isolated an mRNA species expressed in IL-2- but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> IL-12-stimulated NK cells</SCOPE>.

This was identified as the mRNA encoding the transcription factor egr-1, which is expressed with fast kinetics in T and NK cells upon IL-2, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> IL-12</SCOPE>, stimulation.

Analysis of the accumulation of mRNA-encoding members of the AP-1 transcription factor family demonstrated that c-fos and junB are also expressed upon stimulation of NK and T cells with IL-2, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> IL-12</SCOPE>, whereas <SCOPE>expression of c-jun and junD is <NEG>not</NEG> modified by either cytokine</SCOPE>.

Our data provide the first demonstration that IL-12-mediated activation of T and NK cells does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> involve expression of members of the immediate-early activation genes family (egr-1, c-fos, and junB), AP-1 transcriptional activity, or bcl-2 expression</SCOPE>.

Studies on unicellular and paired daughter cell culture unequivocally indicate that the shift is mediated by modulation of the HPC differentiation program to the granulopoietic pathway (<SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> RA-induced down-modulation of multipotent/erythroid/monocytic HPC growth coupled with recruitment of granulocytic HPCs</SCOPE>).

In contrast, <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> the RA-stimulated, RARE-mediated transcription <NEG>nor</NEG> the induced RAR-beta expression was suppressed by VitD3</SCOPE>, suggesting that VitD3 selectively inhibited the retinoid-induced differentiation program but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the RARE-mediated signal</SCOPE>.

Pb-induced activation of NF-kappa B is blocked by antibodies for p65 and p50 subunits but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> cRel</SCOPE>, indicating that the p65:p50 heterodimer (NF-kappa B) is involved.

Pb did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> activate NF-kappa B in 4 different T cell lines</SCOPE>, suggesting that lymphoid cell lines may <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> be reliable surrogates for the study of transcriptional activation in human T cells</SCOPE>.

The catalytic domain of pp56(lck), but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> its regulatory domain</SCOPE>, is sufficient for inducing IL-2 production.

Two pp56(lck) mutants <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> either the entire catalytic domain or the entire NH2 regulatory domain</SCOPE> were generated, and their abilities to trigger transactivation of the TCR-regulated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) region of the IL-2 promoter were compared.

Only the catalytic, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the NH2 regulatory</SCOPE>, domain of pp56(lck) was able to induce NF-AT region transactivation on its own and to cooperate with other intracellular signals to trigger this response.

Induction of fra-1 following engagement of CD40 did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> require protein synthesis</SCOPE>, suggesting that the PKC-dependent linkage between CD40 and fra-1 is direct.

Overexpression of Bcl-2 in tumor cells blocks apoptosis induced by many stimuli, but <SCOPE>inhibition of Fas-mediated killing has <NEG>not</NEG> been consistently observed</SCOPE>.

Transient overexpression of Bcl-2 in mouse and human T cell blasts did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> block Fas-mediated apoptosis</SCOPE>, whereas etoposide- and glucocorticoid-induced cytotoxicity was potently inhibited.

Expression of Bcl-xL and adenovirus E1B 19K did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> interfere with anti-Fas killing</SCOPE>.

The last 13 amino acids containing a PXQXT/S sequence are highly conserved in human and simian EBV LMP1 but do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> bind TRAF3</SCOPE>, suggesting a distinct role for this conserved region of LMP1.

Here we report that sustained high concentrations of Ca2+, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> transient pulses</SCOPE>, are required to maintain NF-AT transcription factors in the nucleus, where they participate in Ca2+-dependent induction of genes required for lymphocyte activation and proliferation.

Furthermore, overexpression and constitutive nuclear localization of NF-AT, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> Jun, Fos, NF-kappaB, Oct or Ets</SCOPE> family members, renders the interleukin-2 enhancer in Jurkat T lymphocytes resistant to FK506 and cyclosporin A.

However, IFN(alpha) does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> have any effects on the retinoid-dependent regulation of the myeloid surface markers CD11b and CD33</SCOPE>.

The IFN-dependent increase in RAR(alpha) levels and the enhancing effect of the cytokine on retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers expression may be a characteristic of PML-RAR positive cells, since <SCOPE>the phenomena are <NEG>not</NEG> observed in HL-60 promyelocytes</SCOPE>.

We demonstrate that although the individual components of this element do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> respond to IL-2</SCOPE>, together they form a composite element capable of conferring IL-2 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter.

The use of the protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK )-specific inhibitor herbimycin A dramatically decreased cellular proliferation <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> altering the activity of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeat (HIV-1 LTR)</SCOPE>, a promoter largely dependent on the binding of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B).

In contrast, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase specific inhibitor H-89 totally inhibited HIV-1 LTR activity at a concentration as low as 100 nM <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> affecting cellular proliferation</SCOPE>.

While PKC depletion did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> alter the NF-kappa B level</SCOPE>, treatment of B lymphocytes with H-89 or herbimycin A provoked a decrease in the NF-kappa B level.

Active suppression of the class II transactivator-encoding AIR-1 locus is responsible for the <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of major histocompatibility complex class II gene expression</SCOPE> observed during differentiation from B cells to plasma cells.

Class II molecules are <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> expressed in plasma cells</SCOPE> because of an active suppression resulting in the abrogation of class II gene transcription.

We show here that the plasma cell-specific repressor function, designated SIR (suppressor of immune response genes), does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> act directly on the transcription of class II genes</SCOPE>, but instead on the transcription of the AIR-1 gene, whose product, the class II transactivator (CIITA), is fundamental for the regulation of the constitutive and inducible expression of MHC class II genes.

This was unambiguously demonstrated by the fact that plasmacytoma x B cell hybrids carrying an AIR-1 locus derived from CIITA-expressing cells do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> express CIITA-specific transcripts</SCOPE>.

Interestingly, in CIITA-transfected cell hybrids, <SCOPE>cell surface expression of the human HLA-DQ heterodimer was <NEG>not</NEG> observed</SCOPE>.

This result was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> attributable to <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of HLA-DQ alpha or -DQ beta transcription</SCOPE></SCOPE>, because both transcripts were present in the CIITA-transfected hybrids, although at reduced levels.

Lobular or mucinous samples showed few or <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> alterations</SCOPE>, whereas most ductal samples had high chromosome 1 polysomy with under-representation of 1p36.

Although 2 early lytic transcripts, BZLF1 and BHRF1, were also detected in 13 and 10 cases, respectively, the <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of ZEBRA staining</SCOPE> in any case indicates that these lytic transcripts are most likely expressed by rare cells in the biopsies entering lytic cycle.

<SCOPE><NEG>Lack</NEG> of IL-12 signaling in human allergen-specific Th2 cells</SCOPE>.

The majority of these TCC exhibited a strongly polarized Th2 cytokine profile, and <SCOPE>the production of IFN-gamma <NEG>could not</NEG> be induced by exogenous IL-12</SCOPE>.

The IL-12 nonresponsiveness of the Th2 clones was further evident by the total <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of IL-12-induced phosphorylation of STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-4)</SCOPE>, a transcription factor that is typically involved in IL-12 signaling.

Our results indicate that human allergen-specific Th cells with strongly polarized Th2 cytokine profiles do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> respond to IL-12</SCOPE> and , therefore , <SCOPE><NEG>can not</NEG> be induced to produce IFN-gamma</SCOPE>.

Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> for Stat1 or Stat5</SCOPE>.

Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> Stat1</SCOPE> and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system.

In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation</SCOPE>.

These data demonstrate that Stat3 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> Stat1 or Stat5</SCOPE> is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine.

High levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> other human tissues</SCOPE>.

We report here that PML is expressed at low levels or <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> expressed</SCOPE> in normal circulating human monocytes, lymphocytes, and polymorphonucleate cells, but is markedly induced by interferon; that PML and PML/RAR alpha expression is augmented by interferon in the NB4 APL cell line, which carries the t(15;17), and in APL blasts from patients; that interferon inhibits growth and survival of NB4 APL cells in cooperation with RA; that interferons alone have minimal maturation effect on NB4 cells; and , finally, that interferon gamma, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> alpha or beta</SCOPE>, induces maturation and growth suppression of NB4 cells with de novo retinoid resistance, and partially restores RA response.

Cells with nuclear p50 were <SCOPE><NEG>negative</NEG> for the CD38, CD20 and CD2 markers</SCOPE>.

These results show that , physiologically, high levels of nuclear of p50, p52 and RelB are restricted to accessory cells of the immune system, which include FDC in GC, and DC and macrophages in the T cell zone, that specialized scavenger macrophages from GC do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> have detectable levels of p52 and RelB</SCOPE>, whereas macrophages from the T cell area, known to present the antigen to T cells, do have both nuclear p52 and RelB, and that in the T cell zone, p52 and RelB are located in nuclei of both CD1a+, CD68+ or both, cells APC, whereas p50 is restricted to CD1a- and CD68- APC.

CD40, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> lipopolysaccharide and anti-IgM stimulation of primary B lymphocytes</SCOPE>, leads to a persistent nuclear accumulation of RelB.

LPS stimulation did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> give rise to a persistent nuclear accumulation of RelB and c-Rel</SCOPE>, whereas nuclear c-Rel, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> RelB</SCOPE>, accumulated after B cell receptor stimulation.

S107 plasmacytoma cells, which express CD40 but are defective for the nuclear appearance of p50/p65-NF-kappaB, do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> express RelB after CD40 stimulation</SCOPE>.

Since LPS and anti-IgM were <SCOPE><NEG>unable</NEG> to activate RelB</SCOPE>, CD40 appears to trigger a special program of gene expression involved in the proliferation and/or differentiation of B lymphocytes.

The CpG dinucleotide in this element is selectively methylated in Th2 T cells and other cells that do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> express IFN-gamma</SCOPE>, and methylation markedly reduces transcription factor binding.

Contrary to the idea that protein kinase C is involved in TCR-mediated activation of NF-kappaB, high doses of staurosporine did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> interfere with activation of NF-kappaB by PHA</SCOPE>, while the same dose of staurosporine completely blocked activation by PMA.

This result demonstrates that Tyr-492 and Tyr-493 are <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> responsible for the Src homology domain 2-mediated association of p56(lck) with ZAP-70</SCOPE>.

Unlike classical NFkappaB sites, <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> the SNE <NEG>nor</NEG> the SEE motif responded to phosphatase inhibition by okadaic acid</SCOPE>.

A 40-fold stimulation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity mediated by four tandem repeats of the SNE could be induced within 2 h ( and up to 250-fold within 6 h) after addition of TPA in DNA-transfected U-937 cells, indicating that the stimulation appeared likely to be a true protein kinase C-mediated signal transduction event <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> a differentiation response</SCOPE>.

We find that , although the variant octamer motif binds Oct-1 and Oct-2 in vitro with 5-fold lower affinity than the consensus octamer motif, mutation of the variant octamer motif to either a consensus octamer or non-octamer motif has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on transcriptional activation from the germline promoter</SCOPE>.

In contrast, gp41 <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to stimulate NF-kappaB binding activity in as much as <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> NF-kappaB bound to the main NF-kappaB-binding site 2 of the IL-10 promoter after addition of gp41</SCOPE></SCOPE>.

Specific inhibitors of p70(S6)-kinase (rapamycin), and Gi protein (pertussis toxin), prevented induction of IL-10 production by gp41 in monocytes, while inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (wortmannin) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (PD 98059) did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

Thus HIV-1 gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation in monocytes may <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> involve NF-kappaB, MAPK, or PI 3-kinase activation</SCOPE>, but rather may operate through activation of adenylate cyclase and pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi/Go protein to effect p70(S6)-kinase activation.

However, <SCOPE>the HTLV-I genes including Tax are <NEG>not</NEG> expressed significantly in primary leukemic cells from ATL patients</SCOPE>.

One T-cell line derived from ATL leukemic cells, TL-Om1, displayed constitutive NF-kappaB activity, as well as enhanced degradation of IkappaBalpha, despite the <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of detectable Tax expression</SCOPE>.

The CD34+ myelomonocytic cell line KG1 differentiates into dendritic-like cells in response to granulocyte-macrophage CSF plus TNF-alpha, or PMA (with or <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> the calcium ionophore ionomycin, or TNF-alpha</SCOPE>), with different stimuli mediating different aspects of the process.

IL-2-mediated cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> require NF-kappa B or activating protein-1 activation in primary human T cells</SCOPE>.

The current study clearly demonstrates that IL-2 does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce I kappa B alpha degradation or NF-kappa B activation in primary human T cells that respond to IL-2 by entering the cell cycle and avoiding apoptosis</SCOPE>.

Similarly, IL-2 <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> activates JNK <NEG>nor</NEG> increases AP-1 binding activity to a consensus o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) response element</SCOPE>.

These data show that <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> NF-kappa B <NEG>nor</NEG> AP-1 activation is required for IL-2-mediated survival or cell cycle progression in activated primary human T cells</SCOPE>.

CD40 expression could be enhanced in CD40-positive MM by stimulation with IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by interleukin (IL)-1beta or CD40 triggering</SCOPE>.

When two 4-trifluoromethyl salicylate derivatives [2-acetoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-benzoic acid (triflusal) and its deacetylated metabolite 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid (HTB)] were compared with aspirin and sodium salicylate as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, we observed that in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-activated human blood, triflusal, aspirin, and HTB, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sodium salicylate</SCOPE>, inhibited COX-2-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production (IC50 = 0.16, 0.18, 0.39, and &gt;10 mM, respectively).

To test this apparent discrepancy, we realized that HTB and triflusal (but <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> aspirin <NEG>nor</NEG> salicylate</SCOPE>) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of COX-2 protein expression in peripheral human mononuclear cells.

Unexpectedly, the presence of nuclear I(kappa)B(alpha) did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> inhibit NF-kappaB binding to DNA</SCOPE> and this phenomenon was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> due to the presence of IkappaBbeta at the nuclear level</SCOPE>.

Immunoprecipitation experiments <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to demonstrate an association between nuclear I(kappa)B(alpha) and NF-kappaB proteins</SCOPE>.

Our results demonstrate that in resting and PMA-activated human PBL, I(kappa)B(alpha) is present in the nucleus in <SCOPE>an apparently inactive form <NEG>unable</NEG> to disrupt NF-kappaB binding from DNA</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> evidence for inflammatory cytokine production was obtained under these conditions</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, it demonstrates that aging does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> influence the sensitivity of this phosphatase</SCOPE>.

Finally, we demonstrate that a <SCOPE><NEG>failure</NEG> to degrade IkappaB-alpha in cytosols of TNF-treated T cells pretreated with PAO</SCOPE> is due to its interference with the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> due to its inhibitory effect on proteasomal degradation</SCOPE>.

These data collectively suggest that PAO interferes with the phosphorylation and the regulated degradation of IkappaB-alpha, induced by TNF, <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> affecting the chymotryptic activity of the proteasome</SCOPE>, independent of age.

Our previous studies pertaining to macrophage response to LPS identified a novel DNA-binding domain located from -550 to -487 in the human TNF-alpha promoter that contains transcriptional activity, but <SCOPE><NEG>lacks</NEG> any known NF-kappaB-binding sites</SCOPE>.

Interaction between immunoglobulin-like transcript-2/leukocyte Ig-like receptor 1 on NKL cells and HLA-B27 on target cells leads to an impairment of NKL natural cytotoxicity, which correlates with an <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of JunB, FosB, and c-Fos transcription</SCOPE>, as well as an <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of their DNA-binding activity</SCOPE>.

By using PD98059, we demonstrated that the Raf1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the DNA binding of NF-kappa B</SCOPE> but, rather, acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B.

In contrast, another inducible gene expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (a CC chemokine) and the activation of the transcriptional factor (FcRFgamma) bound to the gamma response region were similarly or less abundantly induced by IFNgamma treatment in PMA- or RA-differentiated U937 cells, indicating that increased IP-10 mRNA induction was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> due to the augmented ability of the cells to respond to the presence of IFNgamma</SCOPE>.

STAT1, which is activated in response to many lymphocyte-activating cytokines including the interferons, is essential for cell-mediated immunity, as the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of this protein</SCOPE> is associated with prominent defects in the ability to control viral infections.

Here we show that fludarabine, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A</SCOPE>, inhibits the cytokine-induced activation of STAT1 and STAT1-dependent gene transcription in normal resting or activated lymphocytes.

Fludarabine caused a specific depletion of STAT1 protein (and mRNA) but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> of other STATs</SCOPE>.

Interestingly, CyA and indomethacin did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> suppress tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced adhesion molecule expression on HUVECs</SCOPE>, whereas aspirin had an inhibitory effect.

In addition, aspirin and indomethacin, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> CyA</SCOPE>, induced Hsp70 expression in HUVECs that correlated with induction of HSF-1 activity.

CONCLUSION: Our results show that the tested agents (<SCOPE><NEG>except</NEG> indomethacin</SCOPE>) are inhibitors of the T cell-mediated immune response, as expected, that aspirin is an effective suppressor of adhesion molecule expression, and that all three agents can induce Hsp60 in HUVECs.

In contrast, HePTP had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effects on N-terminal c-Jun kinase or on events upstream of the MAP kinases</SCOPE>.

The specificity of HePTP correlated with its physical association through its noncatalytic N terminus with Erk and another MAP kinase, p38, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> Jnk or other proteins</SCOPE>.

In contrast, Grb2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with Sos1 and Sos2 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with SLP-76</SCOPE>.

Moreover, tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT/pp36/38 in detergent lysates prepared from anti-CD3 stimulated T cells associated with Grb2 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> GrpL</SCOPE>.

Taken together, these data indicate that the unexpected expression of megakaryocytic genes is a specific property of immortalized cells <SCOPE>that <NEG>cannot</NEG> be explained only by enhanced expression of Spi-1 and/or Fli-1 genes</SCOPE>.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human monocytes were stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml) alone or LPS (100 ng/ml) with and <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> a nonspecific serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (Stauro), a specific pan-PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (Bis), or an inhibitor of PTK genistein (Gen)</SCOPE>.

5. Neutrophil apoptosis and inhibition of neutrophil function were induced at lower concentrations of SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO than those inducing loss of membrane viability, with SMX having <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect</SCOPE>.

However, although Wnt signals are known to inhibit the activity of the negative regulatory protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), resulting in increased levels of beta-catenin, we find <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> evidence for involvement of GSK-3beta in Tcf-mediated transcription in T cells</SCOPE>.

That is, a dominant negative GSK-3beta does not specifically activate Tcf transcription and stimuli (lithium or phytohemagglutinin) that inhibit GSK-3beta activity also do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> activate Tcf reporter genes</SCOPE>.

We show, however, that the presence of CIITA does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the stability of the higher-order protein complex formed on DNA by RFX, X2BP and NF-Y</SCOPE>.

Finally, we conclude that this effect of CIITA is cell-type specific, since expression of CIITA is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> required for normal occupation of MHC class II promoters in B lymphocytes</SCOPE>.

PG490 inhibits the induction of DNA binding activity at the purine-box/antigen receptor response element (ARRE)/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT) target sequence but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> at the NF-kappaB site</SCOPE>.

In 16HBE human bronchial epithelial cells, IL-8 expression is regulated predominantly by NF-kappaB, and PG490 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> cyclosporin A</SCOPE> can completely inhibit expression of IL-8.

Transient transfection of endothelial cells with ICAM-1 promoter luciferase reporter gene (ICAM-1LUC) constructs indicated that deletion of upstream NF-kappa B site (-533 bases from translation start site) had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on thrombin responsiveness</SCOPE>, whereas mutation/deletion of downstream NF-kappa B site (-223 bases from the translation start site) prevented the activation of ICAM-1 promoter, indicating that the downstream NF-kappa B site is critical for thrombin inducibility.

However, <SCOPE>CTLA-4 ligation did <NEG>not</NEG> appear to affect the CD28-mediated stabilization of IL-2 mRNA</SCOPE>.

These results indicate that CTLA-4 signaling inhibits events early in T cell activation both at IL-2 transcription and at the level of IL-2-independent events of the cell cycle, and does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> simply oppose CD28-mediated costimulation</SCOPE>.

The signaling events that link FGF receptor-1 engagement and NF-kappaB activation in Jurkat are probably distinct from the CD28 costimulation pathway, since FGF-1-induced Rel/kappaB binding proteins do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> contain significant levels of c-Rel</SCOPE> and are <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> identical with the CD28 response complex</SCOPE>.

In the culture system reported here, (1) the growth factor (GF) stimulus induces cord blood (CB) progenitor cells to proliferate and differentiate/mature exclusively along the erythroid lineage; (2) this erythropoietic wave is characterized by less than 4% apoptotic cells; (3) <SCOPE>asymmetric divisions are virtually <NEG>absent</NEG></SCOPE>, ie, nonresponsive hematopoietic progenitors with <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> erythropoietic potential</SCOPE> are forced into apoptosis; (4) the system is cell division controlled (cdc), ie, the number of divisions performed by each cell is monitored.

Freshly isolated CD34(+) cells expressed CD34, c-kit, PU.1, and GATA-2 but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> express CD36, erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), SCL/Tal1, EKLF, NF-E2, GATA-1, or glyocophorin A (GPA)</SCOPE>.

In late stages of erythroid maturation, GPA was upregulated, whereas CD34, c-kit, PU.1, and GATA-2 were barely or <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> detected</SCOPE>.

Enforced expression of Id3, which has the capacity to inhibit many basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, in human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells that have <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> undergone T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements</SCOPE> inhibits development of the transduced cells into TCRalpha beta and gamma delta cells in a fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC).

Here we document that overexpression of Id3, in progenitors that have initiated TCR gene rearrangements (pre-T cells), inhibits development into TCRalpha beta but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> into TCRgamma delta T cells</SCOPE>.

We have introduced a small deletion within beta-catenin (Delta19) that disrupts binding to LEF-1, E-cadherin, and APC but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> axin</SCOPE>.

This Delta19 beta-catenin mutant localizes to the nucleus because it may <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> be efficiently sequestered in the cytoplasm</SCOPE>.

beta-Catenin and LEF-1 complexes can activate reporter gene expression in a transformed T-lymphocyte cell line (Jurkat) but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in normal T lymphocytes</SCOPE>, even though both factors are nuclear.

Thus, localization of both factors to the nucleus is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sufficient for activation of gene expression</SCOPE>.

Transgene expression did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the thymic development</SCOPE>, but led to lowered numbers of splenic T cells and to a dramatic decrease in the ex vivo proliferative response of splenic T lymphocytes.

We show that PNU156804 does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> inhibit c-myc and bcl-2 mRNA induction</SCOPE>.

PNU156804 action is restricted to some signaling pathways; it does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect NF-kappa B activation by PMA in T cells</SCOPE> but blocks that induced by CD40 cross-linking in B lymphocytes.

We showed that IL-12 had a direct effect on IRF-1, <SCOPE>an effect <NEG>not</NEG> mediated indirectly by the induction of IFN-gamma production</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, IL-2 and IL-12 synergistically induced IRF-1, whereas IFN-alpha and IL-12 did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

In contrast to IL-12, <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> up-regulation of IRF-1 was found in IL-4-stimulated cells</SCOPE>, and IL-4 did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> block IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1</SCOPE>.

Therefore, IRF-1 may be an important contributor to IL-12 signaling, and we speculate that the defective IL-12 responses seen in IRF-1-/- mice might be attributable, in part, to the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of this transcription factor</SCOPE>.

To determine why alveolar macrophages do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> express AP-1 DNA binding activity</SCOPE>, we first showed that there was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> a decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN proteins that make up the AP-1 complex</SCOPE>.

Pretreatment of cultured human ECs with the PPARalpha activators fenofibrate or WY14643 inhibited TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, an effect <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> seen with PPARgamma activators</SCOPE>.

We conclude that downregulation of WT1 during induced differentiation of K562 cells is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> a prerequisite for erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation of these cells</SCOPE>.

By examining in vitro-differentiated embryonic stem cells, we showed previously that in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of GATA-1</SCOPE>, committed erythroid precursors <SCOPE><NEG>fail</NEG> to complete maturation</SCOPE> and instead undergo apoptosis.

The data obtained show that the three GCH molecules exert an immunosuppression on cytokine production by T lymphocytes and a strong decrease in the nuclear translocation of NF-kB in Jurkat cells; moreover, (a) not all the cytokines investigated were affected, and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with the same intensity</SCOPE>, by the three GCH and (b) DXM inhibited the binding activity of NF-kB less than that of DFC and PDN.

At the 2 microM concentration, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and eosinophil peroxidase did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> stimulate significant levels of IL-8 production</SCOPE>.

However, stimulation with MBP did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> produce an increase in the binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB or activator protein-1</SCOPE>.

MBP also induced transient increases in mRNA for macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta, but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> stimulate the release of either chemokine</SCOPE>.

Whereas the CRE site was essential in mediating the negative activity of the upstream regulatory region in Jurkat but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in HeLa cells</SCOPE>, mutation of the Sp1/AP-2 site decreased promoter activity in both cell lines.

Furthermore, expression of physiological levels of Bcl-x protected B cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of NF-kappaB signaling</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>Without</NEG> NFAT nuclear translocation</SCOPE>, <SCOPE>the FasL gene is <NEG>not</NEG> transcribed</SCOPE>.

Phosphorylated Bcl-2 <SCOPE><NEG>cannot</NEG> bind calcineurin, and NFAT activation, FasL expression</SCOPE>, and apoptosis can occur after Bcl-2 phosphorylation.

<SCOPE>Tumor cell lines with a defective retinoblastoma gene are <NEG>unable</NEG> to transcribe the HLA class II genes in response to IFN-gamma treatment</SCOPE>, and reconstitution of functional Rb rescues IFN-gamma-induced class II gene expression.

By using Jurkat and primary human T lymphocytes, we demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of two second messengers of the TCR-initiated signal transduction, protein kinase C (PKC) and calcineurin, results in the synergistic activation of the IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK) complex but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> of another putative IkappaBalpha kinase, p90(rsk)</SCOPE>.

We also demonstrate that the IKK complex, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> p90(rsk)</SCOPE>, is responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha mediated by the co-activation of PKC and calcineurin.

The requirement for TNF is further confirmed by the observation that the inability of the intermediate CD4(+) CD8(-) CD3(-) thymocytes to replicate the virus is associated with a defect in TNF production during their interaction with TEC and correlates with the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of nuclear NF-kappaB activity in these freshly isolated thymocytes</SCOPE>.

The other major subpopulation expressing the CD4 receptor, namely, the double-positive (DP) CD4(+) CD8(+) CD3(+/-) thymocytes, despite the entry of the virus, do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> produce a significant level of virus</SCOPE>, presumably because they are unresponsive to TNF and IL-7.

Promoter assays revealed CD28-dependent effects on both NF-kappaB and AP-1, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> on NF-AT or the intact IL-2 promoter</SCOPE>.

We conclude that CD28 costimulation can cause substantial T cell proliferation in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of IL-2</SCOPE>, which is driven by a soluble factor independent of NF-AT transactivation.

M0/M1 leukemic cells are <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sensitive to differentiating agents</SCOPE>, whereas M3 leukemic cells are induced to undergo granulocytic differentiation after ATRA treatment but are <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sensitive to VD</SCOPE>.

Tyrosine kinase-dependent, and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> protein kinase C-dependent</SCOPE>, pathways mediate CD23-triggered NF-kappaB activation but do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> participate in the direct phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha</SCOPE>.

However, <SCOPE>the action of dopamine on HIV-1 gene expression in cells of the immune system has <NEG>not</NEG> yet been examined</SCOPE>.

However, in contrast with TNF-alpha, dopamine treatment did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect NF-kappaB DNA binding activity <NEG>nor</NEG> the concentrations of p50, p65 and IkappaB-alpha proteins</SCOPE>, which suggests a distinct NF-kappaB activation mechanism.

NIK <SCOPE><NEG>cannot</NEG> phosphorylate IkappaB-alpha directly</SCOPE>, but it appears to be a functionally important subunit, because mutated NIK inhibited stimulus-induced kappaB-dependent transcription more effectively than mutated IKK-alpha or -beta.

Surprisingly, however, DMSO has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on inducible Rel A binding</SCOPE>.

In this study, we demonstrate that constitutive expression of bcl-xl but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> bcl-2, bcl-xs, bak, bad, or bax</SCOPE> was associated with apoptosis resistance after IL-2 deprivation in CTLL-2 cells that expressed Tax.

However, <SCOPE>the mechanism by which IFNs mediate this inhibition has <NEG>not</NEG> been defined</SCOPE>.

Pretreatment of monocytes with IFN-beta or IFN-gamma, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> IL-1, IL-2, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, or transforming growth factor beta</SCOPE> suppressed activation of STAT6 by IL-4.

This inhibition was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 and was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> evident</SCOPE> unless the cells were preincubated with IFN for at least 1 hr before IL-4 stimulation.

The inhibitory agent has several features characteristic of a ganglioside, including sensitivity to neuraminidase but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> protease</SCOPE> treatment; hydrophobicity; and molecular weight less than 3 kDa.

Indeed, we detected gangliosides in supernatants from RCC explants and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> from adjacent normal kidney tissue</SCOPE>.

This peptide potently inhibited NFAT activation and NFAT-dependent expression of endogenous cytokine genes in T cells, <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> affecting the expression of other cytokines that require calcineurin but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> NFAT</SCOPE></SCOPE>.

Compounds that interfere selectively with the calcineurin-NFAT interaction <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> affecting calcineurin phosphatase activity</SCOPE> may be useful as therapeutic agents that are less toxic than current drugs.

Whereas c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> exist in B cells</SCOPE>, they form and bind to the X2-box in class II nonexpressing cells.

In contrast, <SCOPE>NF-kappa B activity was <NEG>not</NEG> detected in the nucleus following long-term expression of Tax in Jurkat T lymphocytes</SCOPE>.

A significant proportion of transcripts appear to terminate prematurely in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of transactivators</SCOPE>.

Southwestern and gel renaturation experiments with the use of purified protein fractions revealed that TCF-1 alpha activity is derived from a family of 57- to 53-kD proteins that are abundantly expressed in mature and immature T-cell lines (Jurkat, CCRF-CEM) and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in mature B cells (JY, Namalwa) or nonlymphoid (HeLa) cell lines</SCOPE>.

The TCF-1 alpha binding site was also required for TCR alpha enhancer activity in transcriptionally active extracts from Jurkat but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> HeLa cells</SCOPE>, confirming that TCF-1 alpha is a T-cell-specific transcription factor.

Each binding site contributes to the overall activity of the enhancer, however <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> single element seems absolutely required for activity</SCOPE>.

However, despite its ability to activate transcription of a transfected reporter gene, <SCOPE>the factor is apparently <NEG>unable</NEG> to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non-lymphoid cells</SCOPE>: In previous experiments by others, the characteristic in vivo footprint of this factor, designated NF-muE3, was detected in B cells but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in non-B cells</SCOPE>.

From this and other findings the picture emerges that there are at least three categories of factors which mediate cell-type-specific transcription in B lymphocytes: (a) cell-specific factors such as Oct-2A and Oct-2B <SCOPE>that are <NEG>not</NEG> expressed in most other cell types</SCOPE>: (b) ubiquitous factors such as NF-kappa B that are constitutively active in B cells but are sequestered in an inactive form in other cells; (c) ubiquitously active factors, exemplified by the one binding to the E3 sequence motif.

This factor is present in an active form in a variety of cell types but <SCOPE>is apparently <NEG>unable</NEG> to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non-B cells</SCOPE>, perhaps due to a non-permissive chromatin structure of the Ig heavy chain locus.

Treatment of HL-60 cells with both TPA and cycloheximide had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on the rates of c-jun transcription</SCOPE>.

We demonstrate that the NF-microB-binding site plays a critical role in the IgH enhancer, because mutation of the microB DNA motif decreased transcriptional activity of the IgH enhancer in cells of the B-cell lineage but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in nonlymphoid cells</SCOPE>.

Interestingly, alteration of either the microB or E3 site in a 70-base-pair fragment of the IgH enhancer that <SCOPE><NEG>lacks</NEG> the binding site for OCTA</SCOPE> abolished enhancer activity in lymphoid cells completely.

Nevertheless, a multimer of the microB motif alone showed <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> enhancer activity</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> increase in TGF-beta mRNA was observed</SCOPE>.

The increase in c-jun and EGR2, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> c-fos</SCOPE>, mRNA was also abrogated by cytochalasin D.

Unexpectedly, stimulation of cloned stably transfected Jurkat T cells leads to a bimodal pattern of beta-gal expression in which some cells express <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> beta-gal</SCOPE> and others express high levels.

<SCOPE>This expression pattern <NEG>cannot</NEG> be accounted for by cell-cycle position or heritable variation</SCOPE>.

Proliferation and immunologic function of T lymphocytes are initiated by signals from the antigen receptor that are inhibited by the immunosuppressant FK506 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by its structural analog, rapamycin</SCOPE>.

On the other hand, interleukin 2 (IL-2)-induced signals are blocked by rapamycin but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by FK506</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>Neither</NEG> FKBP binding <NEG>nor</NEG> inhibition of rotamase activity of FKBP alone is sufficient to explain the biologic actions of these drugs</SCOPE>.

We have investigated the induction of these genes by macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) in human monocytes that do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> proliferate in response to M-CSF</SCOPE> but require the factor for optimal cell differentiation.

The c-jun gene expression was very transient and was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> detectable by 60 min after M-CSF addition</SCOPE>.

The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> block the induction of any of these genes</SCOPE>, and in fact, super-induced the expression of c-jun and hck.

Therefore, in normal human monocytes M-CSF induces immediate early response genes <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> inducing cell proliferation</SCOPE>.

Stimulation of a human T-cell clone with anti-CD3 or tumor necrosis factor induces NF-kappa B translocation but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> human immunodeficiency virus 1 enhancer-dependent transcription</SCOPE>.

Interleukin 2 induced proliferation but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> NF-kappa B translocation or LTR transactivation</SCOPE>.

Phorbol ester or specific antigen recognition induced HIV LTR transactivation, whereas stimulation with tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

Our finding that induction of NF-kappa B by tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sufficient to induce HIV enhancer-dependent transcription in cloned T cells</SCOPE> contrasts with results obtained in most lymphoblastoid T-cell lines and indicates that normal T lymphocytes differ from tumoral T cells in terms of requirements for HIV LTR activation.

Because insertion mutations in phoP are polar on phoQ, we constructed strains that expressed the PhoQ protein in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of PhoP</SCOPE> to test whether resistance to defensin requires only the phoQ gene product.

We found that resistance to defensin requires the function of both components of this regulatory system, because strains expressing PhoQ <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> PhoP</SCOPE> were still markedly sensitive to defensins.

We also tested for the ability of defensins NP-1, NP-5, and HNP-1 to activate pag expression and found that these peptides have <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect</SCOPE>.

Defensin resistance is not the only virulence characteristic controlled by the PhoP-PhoQ regulon because mutations in pagC, as well as ones in the phoP locus that resulted in constitutive pag activation (phenotype PhoPc), had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on defensin resistance</SCOPE>, even though they rendered the organism avirulent and deficient in survival within macrophages.

This inhibitor did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect protein kinase C-mediated gene transcription</SCOPE>, suggesting that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases are involved in the signal transduction pathway for IL-1 in a number of responsive cell types.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) potently stimulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1-long terminal repeat (HIV-1-LTR) CAT constructs transfected into monocyte/macrophage-like cell lines but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> a T cell line</SCOPE>.

LPS is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> able to induce HIV-1 production in a cloned T cell line</SCOPE>.

TNF-alpha was able to increase expression of the HIV LTR in T cells, but in monocytic cells, TNF-alpha did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce the HIV LTR above a constitutive level of activity</SCOPE>.

This level of NF-kappa B-independent activity appears to be sufficient for virus multiplication, since TNF-alpha treatment had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on the kinetics of de novo HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection and viral RNA production in U937 cells</SCOPE>.

In melanoma cells that contain the N-Oct-3 factor, <SCOPE>a transfected lymphocyte-specific promoter was <NEG>neither</NEG> activated <NEG>nor</NEG> was it repressed upon contransfection with an Oct-2A expression vector</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>Instead</NEG> of NF kappa B</SCOPE>, the activator protein 3 binds to the divergent site in HIV-2.

When the human epsilon- or beta-globin genes driven by the dominant control region (DCR) are introduced into this system, <SCOPE>the human epsilon-globin gene, in contrast to the beta-globin gene, is <NEG>not</NEG> deregulated by the presence of the DCR</SCOPE> and is expressed strictly as an embryonic gene.

We conclude from this that <SCOPE>the epsilon-globin gene is <NEG>not</NEG> regulated by competition with other genes in the human beta-globin locus</SCOPE>.

5&apos; deletion constructs which <SCOPE><NEG>lacked</NEG> the Y box</SCOPE>, but retained the &quot;octamer&quot; motif and TATA box were completely inactive, and internal deletion of the Y box reduced transcription by 95%.

Using supercoiled, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> linear templates</SCOPE>, we observed differences in transcription efficiencies from templates <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG></SCOPE> or disrupting the X consensus element that reflect effects of random replacement of X box sequences in transient expression assays.

Demonstration of the complete dependence on the Y box in this system suggests that, despite its demonstrated importance in the DRA promoter, the DRA &quot;octamer&quot; does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> utilize OTF-2 in a manner analogous to immunoglobulin promoters in B cells</SCOPE>.

These results suggest that OTF-1, <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> OTF-2</SCOPE>, is sufficient for transcription of immunoglobulin genes and that OTF-2 alone is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> responsible for the B-cell-specific regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression</SCOPE>.

We have identified and separated four nuclear proteins from C81-66-45 cells, an HTLV-I immortalized Tax-expressing human T-lymphocyte line (Salahuddin et al., 1983), that interact with the TRE-DNA, <SCOPE><NEG>none</NEG> of which are identical with the Tax-protein</SCOPE>.

A recent functional analysis by Miyatake et al. (S. Miyatake, M. Seiki, M. Yoshida, and K. Arai, Mol. Cell. Biol. 8:5581-5587, 1988) described a short promoter region in the GM-CSF gene that conferred strong inducibility by T-cell-activating signals and tax1, but <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> NF-kappa B-binding motifs were identified</SCOPE>.

Exogenous ETS1, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> ELF1</SCOPE>, can transactivate GM-CSF, through the GM5 site, in a PMA/ionomycin dependent manner.

Mutation of the core ETS binding site from -GGAA- to -GGAT- prevents the binding of ETS-like factors <SCOPE><NEG>with the exception of</NEG> ETS1</SCOPE>.

We demonstrate in this report that the 5&apos; flanking DNA of the 15-lox gene contains sequences which down-regulate its activity in a variety of non-erythroid cell lines but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in two erythroid cell lines</SCOPE>.

The main activity of the silencer has been mapped to the first 900 bp of 5&apos; flanking DNA, which contains nine binding sites for a nuclear factor present in non-erythroid cells but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in erythroid cells</SCOPE>.

These syncytia <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> activated cells</SCOPE> as determined by an <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of staining for Ki-67 cell cycle antigen</SCOPE>.

T cells <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> active NF-kappa B</SCOPE> but express Sp1 as expected.

However, DCs <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> Sp1</SCOPE>, which may explain the <SCOPE><NEG>failure</NEG> of HIV-1 to replicate in purified DCs</SCOPE>.

Since DCs and memory T cells frequently traffic together in situ, these unusual heterologous syncytia could develop in infected individuals and lead to chronic HIV-1 replication <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> ostensible immune stimulation</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>Neither</NEG> phosphorylation <NEG>nor</NEG> degradation of I kappa B alpha was observed upon TNF-alpha stimulation in the presence of Cu2+</SCOPE>.

In contrast, two other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen and indomethacin, did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> inhibit LPS induction of the TF gene</SCOPE>.

It has long been a puzzle that MHC class II molecules are expressed in human T cells after activation but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in mouse T cells</SCOPE>; this expression is believed to play a role in the cell mediated immune response.

Here we show that human T cells expressing MHC class II have CIITA transcripts while MHC class II-negative human T cells and mouse T cells do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

These data indicate that the expression of CIITA explains the expression or <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of expression of MHC class II in human and mouse T cells respectively</SCOPE>.

Proteolytic activity of the enzyme was required for this effect since diisopropyl fluorophosphate-thrombin <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to increase [Ca2+]i</SCOPE>.

FK506 suppressed the transcriptions through the AP-1 or kappa B-like sites induced by PMA plus Ca(2+)-mobilizing agents, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> those induced by Ca(2+)-independent stimuli</SCOPE>.

In contrast, FK506 or EGTA (Ca2+ chelator) similarly affected the formation of kappa B-like site binding complexes, <SCOPE>which were <NEG>not</NEG> recognized by any antibodies against the human Rel family proteins (c-Rel, p65, p50, and p49)</SCOPE>.

The CD14 LPS receptor is, however, up-regulated (<SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> down-regulated</SCOPE>) in tolerant cells, and LPS can, in fact, still lead to activation of tolerant cells as evidenced by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B).

Agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> basal adhesion</SCOPE>, was inhibited in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by alpha-tcp.

Probucol (50 microM) and N-acetylcysteine (20 mM) also inhibited agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion; whereas, several other antioxidants had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> significant effect</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>Protein kinase C (PKC) does <NEG>not</NEG> appear to play a role in the alpha-tcp effect</SCOPE> since <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> suppression of phosphorylation of PKC substrates was observed</SCOPE>.

Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B is reported to be necessary but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sufficient for E-selectin expression in EC</SCOPE>.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to show an alpha-tcp-induced decrease in activation of this transcription factor after cytokine stimulation</SCOPE>.

We therefore reexamined this issue by using two different experimental approaches that allowed LMP1- induced effects to be monitored immediately following expression of the viral protein and in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of selective pressures</SCOPE>; activation of the NF-kappa B transcription factor and upregulation of the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 were used as early indices of LMP1 function.

In the same experiments, all three non-B-cell lines showed NF-kappa B activation and ICAM-1 upregulation but <SCOPE><NEG>never</NEG> any effect upon Bcl-2</SCOPE>.

CD14-mediated translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B induced by lipopolysaccharide does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> require tyrosine kinase activity</SCOPE>.

A critical issue concerns the mechanism by which CD14, which has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> transmembrane domain</SCOPE>, transduces its signal following LPS binding.

Protein synthesis inhibitors and corticosteroids, which suppress arachidonate release and the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on translocation of NF-kappa B in CHO/CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells</SCOPE>, demonstrating that NF-kappa B translocation is an early event.

Although TK activity was consistently observed by immunoblotting extracts from activated RAW 264.7 cells, LPS-induced phosphotyrosine residues were <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> observed from similarly treated CHO/CD14 cells</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, the TK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to inhibit translocation of NF-kappa B in CHO/CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells</SCOPE>, although both of these agents inhibited LPS-induced TK activity in RAW 264.7 cells.

These results imply that TK activity is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> obligatory for CD14-mediated signal transduction to occur in response to LPS</SCOPE>.

Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> detect a direct interaction of the CD14 distal Sp1-binding site with the vitamin D3 receptor and its partner, the retinoid X receptor</SCOPE>.

CAML appears to be a new participant in the calcium-signal transduction pathway, implicating cyclophilin B in calcium signalling, even in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of cyclosporin</SCOPE>.

Upon stimulation of the cells, this protein <SCOPE><NEG>no longer</NEG> prevents binding of DNA by Band A</SCOPE>, and suppression of binding is restored within 30 min.

In contrast, SCL mRNA levels did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> decrease significantly between day 7 and day 14 cells</SCOPE>, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms are largely responsible for the decrease in SCL protein observed.

We distinguish the stimuli-specific pathways by showing that the oxidative stimuli trigger NF-kappa B activation in only one of two human T-cell lines (Wurzburg but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> Jurkat</SCOPE>), whereas tumor necrosis factor alpha and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate readily stimulate in both lines.

The adherence-dependent increase in I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels was also <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> a consequence of mRNA stabilization events</SCOPE>.

Interestingly, while increases in both IL-1 beta and I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels were detected in nuclei of adherent monocytes, cytoplasmic levels of IL-1 beta mRNA increased during adherence whereas those of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

We propose that adherent monocytes regulate nuclear processing (or decay) of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA, thereby increasing mRNA levels <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> stimulating I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription</SCOPE>.

Moreover, since inhibition of protein synthesis leads to accumulation of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> stimulating I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription</SCOPE>, we suggest that low cytoplasmic levels of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA are maintained by a translation-dependent degradation mechanism.

<SCOPE>These effects of aspirin were <NEG>not</NEG> related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity</SCOPE>, since indomethacin was ineffective.

2. Danazol did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> alter the degradation rate of ER mRNA in monocytes</SCOPE>.

CD30 cross-linking does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> alter proliferation of ACH-2 cells</SCOPE> and <SCOPE>the induction of HIV expression is <NEG>not</NEG> mediated by endogenous TNF alpha/beta</SCOPE>.

In contrast, integrin ligation with antibodies induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> of FAK or paxillin</SCOPE>.

In adhering cells, pre-treatment with cytochalasin D suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> of Syk</SCOPE>, while IL-1 beta message induction is unaffected.

Inhibition of endogenous NO production by L-N-monomethyl-arginine also induced the expression of VCAM-1, but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> augment cytokine-induced VCAM-1 expression</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>Lack</NEG> of full activation of NF-AT</SCOPE> could be correlated to a dramatically reduced capacity to induce calcium flux and could be complemented with a calcium ionophore.

We now demonstrate that B7, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> LFA-3</SCOPE>, strongly costimulated IL-2 transcription and mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells.

LFA-3 induced moderate levels of AP-1, but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> influence the levels of NF-kappa B</SCOPE>, while B7 costimulation strongly induced both AP-1 and substantially enhanced NF-kappa B binding proteins.

CsA also suppressed E-selectin, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in endothelial cells</SCOPE>, even though the E-selectin promoter is activated by NF-kappa B <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> NFAT</SCOPE>.

To compare the role of CD28, neonatal and adult T cells were stimulated with a pair of mitogenic anti-CD2 antibodies in the presence or <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of anti-CD28 MoAb</SCOPE>.

With anti-CD2 alone, neonatal T cells proliferated slightly but produced <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> detectable IL-2</SCOPE>, whereas adult T cells proliferated vigorously, with significant IL-2 production.

<SCOPE>VDR DNA-binding mutants were <NEG>unable</NEG> to either bind to this element in vitro or repress in vivo</SCOPE>; the VDR DNA-binding domain alone, however, bound the element but also could <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> repress IL-2 expression</SCOPE>.

These results indicate that DNA binding by VDR is necessary but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sufficient to mediate IL-2 repression</SCOPE>.

Genomic sequence upstream of the Fc gamma RIC gene was cloned and subjected to primer extension analysis, which demonstrated a single transcription initiation site <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> a TATA box</SCOPE>.

Double-stranded GIRE sequence, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> a scrambled sequence</SCOPE>, was specifically bound by nuclear proteins from IFN-gamma treated U937 cells.

A naturally occurring mutation (-175 T-C) in the area bound by HMG-I results in overexpression of gamma-globin in adult red blood cells (HPFH) and up-regulation of the gamma-globin promoter in in vitro expression assays; HMG-I does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> bind to this mutant sequence</SCOPE>.

By comparison, an isotype-matched antibody had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on NF-kappa B activation</SCOPE>.

Hematopoietic tissues from these mice display elevated levels of both nuclear NF-kappa B and mRNAs of some, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> all</SCOPE>, genes thought to be regulated by NF-kappa B.

NF-kappa B elevation results in these phenotypic abnormalities because mice <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> both I kappa B alpha and the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B</SCOPE> show a dramatically delayed onset of abnormalities.

Our results indicate that I kappa b beta, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> I kappa B alpha</SCOPE>, is required for the signal-dependent activation of NF-kappa B in fibroblasts.

Activation of Ca(2+)-dependent pathways alone do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> result in the phosphorylation and/or degradation of IkB alpha in Jurkat T or in U937 cells</SCOPE>.

Treatment of T cells with the selective PKC inhibitor GF109203X abrogates the PMA-induced IkB alpha phosphorylation/degradation irrespective of activation of Ca(2+)-dependent pathways, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB alpha induced by TNF-alpha, a PKC-independent stimulus</SCOPE>.

Contrary to the interaction with PKC, Ca(2+)-dependent pathways synergize with TNF-alpha <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> at the level of IkB alpha phosphorylation</SCOPE>, but at the level of its degradation.

Monocytic cell lines and normal peripheral blood monocytes were infected with HIV-1 in vitro and cultured in the presence or <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of F(ab&apos;)2 fragments of monoclonal anti-CR1 or anti-CR3 Abs or with C3 fragments</SCOPE>.

TNF-alpha did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> mediate the translocation of NF-kappa B p50/p65 induced by triggering of complement receptors</SCOPE>.

NF-IL6 mRNA was found in human Jurkat T cells and in the mouse Th2 clone D10, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in Th1 clone 29</SCOPE>.

The peri-kappa B site mediates human immunodeficiency virus type 2 enhancer activation in monocytes but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in T cells</SCOPE>.

This site is conserved among isolates of HIV-2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus, and transfection assays show this site to mediate HIV-2 enhancer activation following stimulation of monocytic but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> T-cell lines</SCOPE>.

This is the first description of an HIV-2 enhancer element which displays such monocyte specificity, and <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> comparable enhancer element has been clearly defined for HIV-1</SCOPE>.

Thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-ATPase, depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores and induces a sustained Ca2+ influx <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> altering phosphatidyl inositol levels</SCOPE>.

TG plus phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> TG alone</SCOPE> induced IL-2 in Jurkat T cells, suggesting that TG had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on protein kinase C (PKC)</SCOPE>.

PMA- but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> TG-induced IL-2R alpha</SCOPE> is inhibited by the PKC inhibitor H7, whereas TG- but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> PMA-induced IL-2R alpha</SCOPE> was inhibited by cholera toxin, forskolin and 1,9-dideoxy forskolin.

In contrast, <SCOPE>NFAT activation by a G-protein-coupled receptor is <NEG>not</NEG> modulated by p95vav overexpression</SCOPE>, suggesting that the effect is specific to the TCR signaling pathways.

We further demonstrate that <SCOPE>the p95vav-induced NFAT activation is <NEG>not</NEG> mimicked by Ras activation</SCOPE>, though its function is dependent upon Ras and Raf.

However, <SCOPE>overexpression of p95vav does <NEG>not</NEG> appear to influence TCR-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation or increases in cytoplasmic free calcium</SCOPE>.

Our studies demonstrate that incubation of human T cells with low concentrations (approximately 1-5 nM) of calyculin A or okadaic acid, potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase type 1 (PP-1) and type 2A (PP-2A), induces the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha even in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of any cellular stimulus</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>This action of the phosphatase inhibitors, which is associated with the activation of the RelA.p50 NF-kappa B heterodimer, is <NEG>not</NEG> affected by agents that block the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, the phosphorylated I kappa B alpha from calyculin A-treated cells, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> that from TNF-alpha-stimulated cells</SCOPE>, is sensitive to PP-2A in vitro, suggesting the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha induced by the two different NF-kappa B inducers.

We further demonstrate that TNF-alpha- and calyculin A-induced I kappa B alpha degradation exhibits similar but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> identical</SCOPE> sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor.

Coexpression of HMG I/Y and Oct-2 in cell lines <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> Oct-2</SCOPE> results in high levels of HLA-DRA gene expression, and in vitro DNA-binding studies reveal that HMG I/Y stimulates Oct-2A binding to the HLA-DRA promoter.

By contrast, Oct-2A is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> involved in the IFN-gamma induction of the HLA-DRA gene in HeLa cells</SCOPE>, but antisense HMG I/Y dramatically decreases the level of induction.

Because these are the characteristics of a signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) protein, we determined whether antibodies to Stat proteins will interfere with gel mobility shift and found that antibodies to IL-4 Stat, also known as Stat6, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> antibodies to other Stat proteins</SCOPE>, interfere with the formation of the IL-4 NAF complex.

Although the binding of this complex is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> cyclosporin-sensitive</SCOPE>, promoter induction is inhibited by cyclosporin treatment.

Co-expression of Ras and calcineurin, however, did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> activate the GM-CSF promoter</SCOPE>, but required the additional expression of NF-kappa B p65.

The thromboxane receptor gene has <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> a TATA <NEG>nor</NEG> a CAAT consensus site</SCOPE>.

Several studies have established that Tat releases an elongation block to the transcription of HIV long terminal repeat (LTR); however, it is not known whether this mechanism alone is sufficient to explain the block to HIV replication in human T cells when <SCOPE>Tat is <NEG>absent</NEG></SCOPE>.

Thus, despite its essential role for releasing an elongation block, <SCOPE>Tat is <NEG>not</NEG> otherwise absolutely required for synthesis of full-length HIV transcripts and assembly of virus particles</SCOPE>.

This occurs with fast kinetics after stimulation, via a CsA-sensitive and Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism that does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> require de novo protein synthesis</SCOPE>.

NK cells do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> express NFATc constitutively</SCOPE>, but NFATc mRNA accumulation is induced in these cells within 2 h of stimulation with CD16 ligands.

However, supershift assays using the available mAb recognizing the T cell NFATc revealed <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> detectable NFATc protein in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from CD16- or phorbol ester-stimulated cells at any time tested, up to 4 h</SCOPE>.

Our previous data obtained from a tax transgenic mouse model revealed that tax transforms mouse fibroblasts but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> thymocytes</SCOPE>, despite comparable levels of tax expression in both tissues.

Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kD protein(s) was observed in the tax transformed fibroblast B line and in HTLV-1 transformed human lymphoid lines, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in thymocytes from Thy-tax transgenic mice</SCOPE>.

The GATA-1 and Sp1 binding sites in this promoter <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> a TATA sequence</SCOPE> were necessary for a high level of transcription activation.

By increasing GATA-1 levels via co-transfection, we were able to transactivate the hEpoR promoter in K562 cells and non-erythroid cells, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in the highly active OCIM1 cells</SCOPE>, although GATA-1 mRNA levels were comparable in OCIM1 and K562.

These data suggest that while GATA-1 can transactivate the EpoR promoter, the level of hEpoR gene expression does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> depend on GATA-1 alone</SCOPE>.

We found that the TCL1 gene was overexpressed in the PBLs of an AT patient with a large clonal T-cell population exhibiting the t(14;14) translocation but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in the lymphocytes of the other cases</SCOPE>.

In EBV-transformed B clones, the chi B site exerted the strongest inducible activity; the NF-AT binding sites showed either <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG></SCOPE> or only weak activity compared to Jurkat T cells.

In contrast, in a number of multiple myeloma cell lines, representing differentiated, plasma cell-like B cells, PU.1 DNA binding activity, mRNA expression, and <SCOPE>Pu box-dependent transactivation were <NEG>absent</NEG></SCOPE> or detectable at a very low level.

At present, it is unclear whether the <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of PU.1 expression and activity in human multiple myeloma cell lines</SCOPE> represents a malignancy-associated defect in these cells or exemplifies a normal developmental regulation in terminally differentiated B cells.

In unstimulated cells which do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> secrete IL-2</SCOPE>, only Sp1 binds to this region, while in stimulated IL-2 secreting cells the inducible EGR-1 protein recognizes this element.

The antagonists, however, had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on phorbol ester-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and kappa B binding activity</SCOPE>.

Pretreatment of monocytes with pertussis toxin inhibited these functions of PAF, whereas cholera toxin had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> inhibitory effect</SCOPE>.

The synergistic antigen receptor initiated signals are mediated through protein kinase C because they can be mimicked by the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with calcium ionophores</SCOPE>; and are staurosporine sensitive but cyclosporine resistant.

Gel shift analyses demonstrate that NF-kappa B nuclear translocation is stimulated primarily by IL-1 <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> by antigen receptor signals</SCOPE>.

Western blot and phosphorylation analyses demonstrate that the synergistic effect on NF-kappa B functional activity is independent of I kappa B alpha (MAD3)-NF-kappa B dissociation in the cytosol and <SCOPE>is <NEG>not</NEG> associated with I kappa B nuclear translocation</SCOPE>.

Aspirin-like drugs (ALD) induce calcium mobilization, an essential component of T cell activation, but do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce the biosynthesis of IL-2</SCOPE>.

We found that ALD induce a transient activation of protein kinase (PKC) but have <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect (in comparison to anti-CD3 antibodies) on protein tyrosine phosphorylation <NEG>nor</NEG> on PCL gamma 1 tyrosine phosphorylation</SCOPE>.

ALD-induced calcium mobilization and PKC activation are independent of tyrosine protein kinase activity as shown by the <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of effect of herbimycin, a tyrosine-protein kinase-specific inhibitor</SCOPE>.

Although we detected <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> IL-2 mRNA in ALD-treated cells</SCOPE>, the nuclei of these cells contain proteins capable of binding to three regulatory sequences in the IL-2 promoter region: NFAT, NF kappa B, and AP-1.

These data suggest that ALD cause transient but significant changes in T cell transmembrane signaling, although <SCOPE>some events induced by stimulation with anti-CD3 antibodies are <NEG>not</NEG> induced by ALD</SCOPE>.

However, the ALD stimulus is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> capable of causing complete T cell activation</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>Several other transcription factors including NF-IL-6, AP-1, AP-2, GR, CREB, Oct-1, and Sp-1 are <NEG>not</NEG> affected by IL-10</SCOPE>.

Further examination reveals that, unlike IL-10, IL-4 enhances mRNA degradation and does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> suppress cytokine gene transcription</SCOPE>.

The nuclear factor binds to the DR alpha and DP alpha element but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to the element in the DQ alpha gene</SCOPE>.

Specifically, removal of the N-terminal 36 amino acids of I kappa B alpha <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to disrupt its ability to form latent complexes with NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm</SCOPE>.

Viral transcription, as measured using LTR-CAT assays, was only slightly enhanced in the HIV-protease expressing cells, while <SCOPE>secretion of IL-2 and expression of the IL-2 receptor were <NEG>not</NEG> affected</SCOPE>.

However, unlike another tumor suppressor protein, p53, Rb did not have any significant effect on basal levels of transcription, suggesting that Rb specifically interacts with IE2 <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> other cellular factors involved in the general transcription machinery</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>Circularization of the EBV genome was <NEG>not</NEG> detected</SCOPE>.

In addition, we demonstrated that the EBNA-1 gene in infected thymocytes was transcribed from the Fp promoter, <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> from the Cp/Wp promoter which is used in latently infected B cells</SCOPE>.

Transcripts encoding gp350/220, the major coat protein of EBV, were identified, but we did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> find any evidence of transcription from the LMP-2A or EBER-1 loci in infected thymocytes</SCOPE>.

In both transformed and normal lymphocytes, OKA stimulation induced intense phosphorylation of the constitutively expressed Sp1 protein in the nucleus, a property of OKA <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> shared by TNF, phorbol ester, or PHA and interleukin 2</SCOPE>.

Responsiveness of LTR constructs deleted of kappa B elements to HIV Tat expression was increased upon OKA but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> TNF stimulation</SCOPE>.

Type II major histocompatibility complex combined immune deficiency (type II MHC CID or bare lymphocyte syndrome) is a congenital immunodeficiency disease characterized by <SCOPE><NEG>absent</NEG> MHC class II expression</SCOPE>.

Since CIITA overexpression in normal cells did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> increase class II expression</SCOPE>, we propose that initiation of CIITA expression serves as the on-off switch, while availability of downstream interactor(s) limits transcription.

Utilizing transient transfection assays in the fetal erythroid cell line, K562, we have shown that the core enhancer of hypersensitivity site 2 can preferentially interact with the proximal gamma-promoter in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of the SSE</SCOPE>, completely silencing a linked beta-promoter.

Furthermore, we show that the ICK-1 binding site does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> confer negative regulation in U937 cells</SCOPE>.

A mutation of the MNP site which does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> abrogate ICK-1 binding</SCOPE> inactivates the GOS19.1 promoter in U937 cells and reduces its activity by fourfold in Jurkat cells.

However, <SCOPE>it was <NEG>not</NEG> detected in lymphoid cells MOLT4 (T cell) and BALL1 (B cell), <NEG>nor</NEG> in K562 erythroblasts</SCOPE>.

By primer extension analysis to discriminate two transcripts, we found that the levels of PAFR transcript 1 (leukocyte-type), but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> PAFR transcript 2 (tissue-type)</SCOPE>, are upregulated by PAF as well as by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in the human stomach cancer cell line (JR-St cells) which expresses both functional PAFR transcript 1 and PAFR transcript 2 endogenously.

Functional analysis of the promoter 1 with a transient expression assay using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene as a reporter showed that both PAF and TPA activated the promoter 1 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the deleted promoter <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> the three consensus binding sites for NF-kappa B located from -571 bp to -459 bp</SCOPE></SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>The element is <NEG>not</NEG> activated upon infection of established EBV-negative B-cell lines</SCOPE>, indicating that EBV <SCOPE><NEG>fails</NEG> to drive these cells to a fully lymphoblastoid phenotype</SCOPE>.

An NF-kappa B binding site is an essential component of the element but alone is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sufficient to account for the activity or the specificity of the element</SCOPE>.

The EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 is capable of transactivating the isolated CD48 NF-kappa B site but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the intact element</SCOPE>, suggesting that the latent membrane protein 1-driven activation of NF-kappa B/Rel must interact with other regulatory pathways to control expression of cellular genes as EBV drives resting B cells into the cell cycle.

It was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> possible to reconstitute dioxin receptor function with proteins expressed in wheat germ lysate</SCOPE>.

In line with these observations, reticulocyte lysate but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> wheat germ lysate</SCOPE> promoted the association of de novo synthesized dioxin receptor with hsp90.

Whereas ligand-binding activity correlated with association with hsp90, bHLH-hsp90 interaction appeared to be important for DNA-binding activity but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> for dimerization of the receptor</SCOPE>.

At variance, the second peak <SCOPE>which has <NEG>never</NEG> been reported previously</SCOPE>, lasted several hours.

First, cycloheximide strongly potentiated the transcription of the second wave, whereas it <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to affect the early-induced burst</SCOPE>.

Second, tyrphostin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, impaired the expression of the first but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the second junB mRNA peak</SCOPE>.

Conversely, genistein, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, totally abolished the expression of the second peak of junB mRNA whereas it did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the expression of the first peak</SCOPE>.

Activation also induced c-rel and p105/p50 mRNA synthesis, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> p65 mRNA whose expression was constitutive</SCOPE>.

Interestingly, all those early and late events, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the immediate ones</SCOPE>, were inhibited by a neutralizing anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) monoclonal antibody.

These results indicate that the regulation of NF-kappa B activation during T cell activation by TcR/CD3 signals is biphasic: TcR/CD3 triggers its immediate translocation, which is transient if <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> TNF-alpha is present</SCOPE>.

Protein kinase C is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> a downstream effector of p21ras in activated T cells</SCOPE>.

Data is presented, using the potent and selective PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8425 and transient expression of a constitutively active ras mutant, which clearly shows that PKC is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> downstream of p21ras in the induction of NF-AT and AP-1 transcriptional activity and in the expression of IL-2 in human Jurkat T cells</SCOPE>.

Reporter gene experiments demonstrated that NF-kappa B transcriptional activity is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affected by expression of activated p21ras</SCOPE>.

A predominance of p50 NF-kappa B moieties and possibly p50 homodimers or closely related species, <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> the p50-p56 heterodimer of NF-kappa B that is the predominant NF-kappa B species in most T lymphocytic and monocytic cells</SCOPE>, is demonstrated in the nuclei of U1 cells.

Northern blot analysis showed that <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> of these agents reduced LPS-stimulated TF mRNA accumulation</SCOPE>, thereby suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism for the effect.

Furthermore, these conditions did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> result in an accumulation of the less mature forms of TF</SCOPE>.

The effect of antioxidants on tumor necrosis factor appeared to be species specific, with <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor in murine cells</SCOPE>, but with inhibition in human monocytes.

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> germline changes or rearrangements were observed in any of the genes studied</SCOPE>.

Thus, <SCOPE>deregulation of genes encoding for certain hemopoietic growth factors or receptors does <NEG>not</NEG> seem to represent a major mechanism of MDS progression</SCOPE>.

Biochemical studies demonstrate that OBF-1 has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> intrinsic DNA-binding activity</SCOPE> and recognizes the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> those of Oct-4 and Oct-6</SCOPE>.

The OBF-1 mRNA is expressed in a highly cell-specific manner, being most abundant in B cells and essentially <SCOPE><NEG>absent</NEG> in most of the other cells or tissues tested</SCOPE>.

However, <SCOPE>the events leading from the activated receptor to cell lysis are <NEG>not</NEG> understood</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, we show that retinoic acid can also induce apoptosis in these cells through the retinoic acid receptor, whose repressive functions but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> target site specificity</SCOPE>, are similar to those of the glucocorticoid receptor.

Therefore, the primary effect of the receptor in glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis correlates with transcriptional repression <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> activation</SCOPE> and could be mediated by interference with other transcription factors required for cell survival.

These latter effects were due to increases in the nuclear localization of GR, <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to reduced amounts of the other transcription factors</SCOPE>.

When either serine-32 or serine-36 of I kappa B-alpha was mutated, the protein did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> undergo signal-induced phosphorylation or degradation</SCOPE>, and <SCOPE>NF-kappa B could <NEG>not</NEG> be activated</SCOPE>.

Negative, positive, and <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effects of Nef</SCOPE> have also been reported on viral replication in cells.

RESULTS: Both all-trans and 9-cis RA inhibited virus replication in HIV-1 IIIB-infected monocytoid cells, in the presence and <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of the co-stimulatory agent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)</SCOPE>.

The retinoids had weak or <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> stimulatory effects on HIV production by T-cell lines</SCOPE>.

Human RXR alpha was significantly expressed in U937 and THP-1 cells, weakly expressed in H9 cells and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> detectable in CEM cells</SCOPE>.

After stimulation by PMA, RXR alpha expression increased in H9 and U937 cells but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in CEM cells</SCOPE>.

We have previously described a mutant B lymphoblastoid cell line, Clone-13, that expresses HLA-DQ in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of HLA-DR and -DP</SCOPE>.

Insertion of oligonucleotides spanning the DQB X-box (but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the DQB-W region or the DQB Y-box</SCOPE>) upstream of -141 in a DRA reporter plasmid rescued expression to nearly wild-type levels.

<SCOPE><NEG>None</NEG> of the hybrid reporter constructs were defective when transfected into the wild-type, HLA-DR/-DQ positive parental cell line, Jijoye</SCOPE>.

This element has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> activity in T cells of the Jurkat line</SCOPE>.

The NFATd element, which binds the transcription factor NFAT-1 and is very active in T cells, is only weakly active in one B clone and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> at all in another</SCOPE>.

HIV-1 expression was activated from J delta K cells by treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), sodium butyrate (NaB), or hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)</SCOPE>, confirming the role of NF-kappa B in mediating TNF-alpha induction of HIV transcription.

This resulted in only a partial inhibition of TNF- or PMA- induced HIV replication in U1 cells, and <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> detectable effect on HIV replication in chronically infected U937 cells</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>These parameters were <NEG>not</NEG> modified by Nef expression in Jurkat cells</SCOPE>, whereas stimulation with the same stimuli resulted in partial inhibition of LTR activation in Nef+ Jurkat cells.

<SCOPE>This inhibition was <NEG>not</NEG> mediated through Nef phosphorylation on Thr-15 or GTP-binding activity</SCOPE> because mutations in critical sites did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> alter this inhibition</SCOPE>.

Analysis of truncated LTRs confirmed that inhibition of LTR activation was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> mediated through NF-kappa B-binding activity</SCOPE> but through the region containing the negative responding elements (NREs).

These results suggest that Nef downmodulates LTR activation <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> significantly inhibiting the capacity of T cells to respond to immunological activations</SCOPE>.

The second abnormality in kappa B-binding activity in T cells from these patients is that <SCOPE>RelA, a member of the Rel homology family which is part of the normal NF-kappa B complex, was <NEG>not</NEG> induced in the nucleus following activation</SCOPE>.

Western blotting analysis did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> detect any RelA in nuclear extracts either before or after stimulation of T cells</SCOPE>.

In HeLa cells as well as in B cells, TNF-alpha rapidly induced nuclear translocation primarily of p50-p65, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> of c-rel</SCOPE>.

Surprisingly, even p65, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> c-rel</SCOPE>, was phosphorylated after induction in vivo, suggesting that TNF-alpha selectively activates only specific NF-kappa B heteromers and that modifications regulate not only I kappa B molecules but also NF-kappa B molecules.

Most of these cells have rearranged their heavy-chain locus but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> their light chain genes</SCOPE>, suggesting that an active v-abl protein interferes with this differentiation step.

These increases occur in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of protein synthesis</SCOPE> but are dependent on inactivation of the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase.

In contrast, TPCK and TLCK did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> block induction of an immediate-early gene encoding the transcription factor, Egr-1</SCOPE>.

&quot;Plus&quot; clones replicated the virus efficiently, whereas &quot;minus&quot; clones did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

These specific proteases are coordinately expressed and were present exclusively in the minus U937 clones, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in the plus clones</SCOPE>, as demonstrated in the case of cathepsin G.

To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control tal-1 expression, we investigated tal-1 chromatin structure in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines and in T-cell lines either with or <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> tal-1 rearrangements</SCOPE>.

Tal-1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in Jurkat, a T-cell line that expresses tal-1 in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of apparent genomic alteration of the locus</SCOPE>.

HS II was weak in hematopoietic cell lines, <SCOPE><NEG>absent</NEG> in Hela</SCOPE>, and greatly enhanced in Jurkat, suggesting that this region might be implicated in the cis-activation of tal-1 promoter 1b in this cell line.

At low GSSG levels, T cells <SCOPE><NEG>cannot</NEG> optimally activate the immunologically important transcription factor NF kappa B</SCOPE>, whereas high GSSG levels inhibit the DNA binding activity of NF kappa B.

Trans-activation of the TP1 promoter and of the BamHI C promoter has already been investigated in detail and appears to be mediated via protein-protein interactions and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by direct binding of EBNA-2 type A (of EBV type 1) to the DNA</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>Promoter constructs with mutations in these sequence elements were <NEG>no longer</NEG> expressed specifically in monocytes</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, multimerized region II sequence elements enhanced the activity of a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter in monocytic cells but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> other cell types tested</SCOPE>.

One of the Drosophila sequences, ttk, is a developmental control gene, while a second does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> contain a zinc finger region</SCOPE> but encodes a structure important in oocyte development.

Insertion of this chimeric promoter (ISG15 LTR) upstream of the human IFNA2 gene directed high levels of IFN synthesis in Tat-expressing cells, while this promoter was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> responsive to tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated activation</SCOPE>.

Virus isolated from IFNA-producing cells was able to replicate in the U937 cells but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> replicate efficiently in U937 cells transduced with the IFNA gene</SCOPE>.

However, PDTC <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to inhibit the endonuclease activity contained in the whole cell lysates</SCOPE>.

Pretreatment of HL-60 cells or thymocytes with 100-500 microM OP for 2 hr, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> 10-60 mM NAC</SCOPE>, suppressed subsequent occurrence of apoptosis induced by etoposide.

In this paper, we report that cross-linking of CD28 (but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> CD2, CD5, LFA-1, or CD7</SCOPE>) leads to an elevation of c-jun mRNA, with only minimal activation of c-fos expression.

CD28-dependent induction of c-jun expression requires protein tyrosine kinase activity, but does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> depend on activation of a phorbol ester-responsive protein kinase C or elevation of cytosolic calcium</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, <SCOPE>CD28-dependent elevation of c-jun mRNA does <NEG>not</NEG> appear to be mediated at the level of mRNA stability</SCOPE>.

A mechanism is suggested whereby expression of c-jun and junB, in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of members of the fos family</SCOPE>, can prevent inappropriate activation of T cells caused by ligation of CD28 in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of a specific antigenic stimulus</SCOPE>.

In such cells, DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B can be detected <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> intentional stimulation</SCOPE>.

By contrast, treatment of cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) will only block LPS-induced NF-kappa B, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the constitutive binding protein</SCOPE>.

Using LPS-free and serum-free conditions, constitutive NF-kappa B can be detected in different cell lines of the monocytic lineage (HL60, U937, THP-1, Mono Mac 1 and Mono Mac 6), but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in Molt 4 T cells or K562 stem cells</SCOPE>.

When ordered according to stage of maturation, <SCOPE>the amount of constitutive NF-kappa B was <NEG>not</NEG> increased in more mature cell lines</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, when inducing differentiation in Mono Mac 6 cells, with vitamin D3, <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> change in constitutive or inducible NF-kappa B can be detected</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>Constitutive NF-kappa B was <NEG>not</NEG> maintained by autocrine action of cytokines TNF, interleukin 6, interleukin 10, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or macrophage colony-stimulating factor</SCOPE>, since neutralizing antibodies did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> reduce constitutive DNA-binding activity</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, blockade of prostaglandin or leukotriene biosynthesis did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect constitutive NF-kappa B</SCOPE>.

We demonstrate in a variety of cell types, including lymphocytes and endometrial stroma, that Pit-1 is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> involved in the regulation of dPRL promoter/reporter gene constructs carrying 3 kb 5&apos;-flanking DNA</SCOPE>.

Our experiments also show that activated PR does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> confer direct transcriptional control on the dPRL promoter</SCOPE>.

When we compared the activity of the transfected dPRL promoter in PRL-secreting and nonsecreting lymphoid cells, we found that the 3 kb 5&apos;-flanking region of the dPRL promoter did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> contain elements restricting expression to only those lymphocytes that produce PRL</SCOPE> but allowed expression of fusion reporter genes irrespective of the status of the endogenous PRL gene.

This was in sharp contrast to endometrial cells where 3 kb 5&apos;-flanking DNA conferred strong transcriptional activation on the dPRL promoter in decidualized endometrial stromal cells actively secreting PRL, but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> allow transcription in undifferentiated non-PRL-secreting endometrial stromal cells</SCOPE>.

Activation of the dPRL promoter construct in these undifferentiated cells could however be induced by the addition of cAMP, in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of progesterone</SCOPE>, suggesting that a signal transduced through the cAMP signaling pathway is a primary inducer of decidual PRL gene expression.

Although both kinases participate in regulating cell growth, there was <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> detectable activation of pp70S6K during TPA- or okadaic acid-induced monocytic differentiation</SCOPE>.

Moreover, rapamycin, an inhibitor of pp70S6K activation, had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on induction of EGR-1 expression</SCOPE>.

In contrast, analysis of pp90rsk activity by phosphorylation of a peptide derived from S6 protein demonstrated stimulation of this kinase in TPA-treated U-937, and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> TUR</SCOPE>, cells.

Addition of rIL-2 fully restored the proliferative response and partially restored the production of IL-4 and IL-5, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> that of other cytokines</SCOPE>.

Interestingly, PGE2 or di-butyryl (Bt2)cAMP abolished the binding of NF-kappa B (p50/p65) heterodimer to the kappa B sequence in cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with PMA/A23187</SCOPE>.

It seems therefore that PGE2, by elevating cAMP levels, interferes with the activation pathway for NF-kappa B but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> for NF-AT, AP-1 or CLE0 binding protein</SCOPE>.

Long-term inositol phosphate release, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> tyrosine kinase activity</SCOPE>, correlates with IL-2 secretion and NF-AT induction in anti-CD3-activated peripheral human T lymphocytes.

Although many second messengers have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for T cell activation in a number of model systems, <SCOPE>the rate-limiting step in peripheral T cells has <NEG>not</NEG> been demonstrated</SCOPE>.

To model effective versus ineffective CD3-mediated stimulation in peripheral T cells, we used two anti-CD3 mAbs that differ in their ability to stimulate purified T cells: OKT3, which causes early second messenger generation but <SCOPE>is <NEG>unable</NEG> to activate T cells <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> a second signal</SCOPE></SCOPE>, and 64.1, which stimulates T cell proliferation on its own.

Thus, NF-AT induction and IL-2 secretion were correlated with the levels of inositol phosphate release but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with gross levels of tyrosine kinase activity induced late following the response</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, cyclosporin A, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> rapamycin</SCOPE>, blocked the synergistic induction of IL-8 expression achieved with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 costimulation.

These results indicate that a component or components of NF-AT have the potential to reconstitute NF(P), whereas NF-kappa B alone does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> account for NF(P) in Jurkat crude extract</SCOPE>.

The two human GATA3 zinc fingers are encoded by two separate exons highly conserved with those of GATA1, but <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> other structural homologies between these two genes can be found</SCOPE>.

Cotransfection of NF-kappa B (p50/p65)- or AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos)- expression vectors into Jurkat cells with a luciferase reporter containing the GM-CSF promoter did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter</SCOPE>.

In EMSAs, NF(P) binding was inhibited by the unlabeled NF-AT binding site but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by the unlabeled AP1 binding site</SCOPE> and purified NF-AT contained an activity that bound to the P sequence.

These results indicate that the component(s) of NF-AT has the potential to reconstitute NF(P) whereas NF-kappa B alone <SCOPE><NEG>cannot</NEG> account for NF(P) in crude extracts</SCOPE>.

Unlike NF-AT, NF(P) does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> contain AP1 as its DNA binding component</SCOPE>.

In comparison to other activators of NF-kappa B such as phorbol myristate acetate or tumor necrosis factor, we did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> detect changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of I kappa B alpha following treatment with either of these agents</SCOPE>.

In most HIV-1 isolates in which <SCOPE>this PU box was <NEG>not</NEG> conserved</SCOPE>, it was replaced by a binding site for the related factor Ets1.

We found that transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR by v-src was more sensitive to mutations of the proximal, <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> the distal</SCOPE>, kappa B element.

On the other hand, stimulation of T cells by mitogens or antibodies to the T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex resulted in the down-regulation of transcriptional factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in cells expressing the nef gene compared with cells <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> expressing the nef gene</SCOPE>.

Because the Nef protein does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the surface expression of the CD3-TCR complex</SCOPE>, we conclude that the Nef protein down-regulates the transcriptional factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in T cells in vitro through an effect on the TCR-dependent signal transduction pathway.

<SCOPE>NF-kappa B activation by TNF alpha was <NEG>not</NEG> correlated with cell differentiation or proliferation</SCOPE>.

In a NGF-responsive rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, PMA activated NF-kappa B, whereas NGF did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

In other neuroblastoma cell lines, such as SK-N-Be(2), the <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of PMA induction of differentiation</SCOPE> was correlated with the <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of NF-kappa B activation</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>NF-kappa B was <NEG>not</NEG> activated by retinoic acid</SCOPE>, which induced morphological differentiation of all the neuroblastoma cell lines used in the present study.

Thus, NF-kappa B activation was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> required for neuroblastoma cell differentiation</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, the results obtained with TNF alpha proved that NF-kappa B activation was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sufficient for induction of neuroblastoma differentiation</SCOPE>.

Although these heterodimers do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> recognize a classical thyroid hormone response element (TRE) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides (DR+4)</SCOPE>, PPAR behaves as a dominant negative regulator of thyroid hormone (TH) action.

However, a TH-dependent positive effect is elicited by selective interaction of the THR beta-PPAR but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the THR alpha-PPAR heterodimer with a novel TRE (DR+2)</SCOPE>.

Nuclei from GATA-1- mutant embryonic stem cells can still be reprogrammed to express their globin genes in erythroid heterokaryons, indicating that <SCOPE>de novo induction of GATA-1 is <NEG>not</NEG> required for globin gene activation following cell fusion</SCOPE>.

Although resting tonsillar B cells did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> express VDR mRNA</SCOPE>, activation of these cells with interleukin-4 induced VDR in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of exogenously supplemented 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3</SCOPE>.

1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited CD23 expression in U937 cells, yet <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to modulate CD23 expression in B cells</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 induced 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression and metabolic activity in both U937 cells and lectin-activated T cells, yet <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA or its metabolic activity in B cells</SCOPE>.

One 63-kDa isoform, termed I kappa B gamma-1, which <SCOPE><NEG>lacks</NEG> 59 amino acids C-terminal to ankyrin repeat 7</SCOPE>, has a novel 35-amino acid C terminus encoded by an alternative reading frame of the p105 gene.

A 55-kDa isoform, I kappa B gamma-2, <SCOPE><NEG>lacks</NEG> the 190 C-terminal amino acids of p70I kappa B gamma</SCOPE>.

The <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> in I kappa B gamma-1 and I kappa B gamma-2 of a protein kinase A site whose phosphorylation modulates p70I kappa B gamma inhibitory activity</SCOPE> suggests that alternative RNA splicing may be used to generate I kappa B gamma isoforms that respond differently to intracellular signals.

Inhibition of cytokine production was gene selective and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> due to general effects on protein synthesis</SCOPE>.

Much higher concentrations of other antioxidants--including ascorbic acid, trolox, alpha-tocopherol, butylated hydroxytoluene, and the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton--did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the production of these cytokines</SCOPE>.

The active compounds did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> inhibit IL-1-induced production of IL-6 in fibroblasts</SCOPE>, showing the cell selectivity of the effect.

THP decreased the concentration of the transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 detected in nuclear extracts of PBMC cultured in the presence or <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of LPS</SCOPE>.

The sequence between position -42 and -76 base pairs (bp) was required for efficient transcription in cells that express alpha 4, but it showed <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> activity in HeLa cells, which do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> express alpha 4</SCOPE></SCOPE>.

Deletion of the 5&apos;-most Ets site had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on binding to GABP alpha/GABP beta</SCOPE>, but it eliminated a.

We conclude that although <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> of the two 5&apos;-most Ets sites alone binds nuclear protein</SCOPE>, they appear to act as modulators which control the pattern of Ets proteins that bind the alpha 4 gene promoter.

In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the TF site bound translated c-Rel and p65 homodimers but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> p50/p65 heterodimers or p50 homodimers</SCOPE>.

In fact, under low-ionic-strength conditions, the TF complex did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> migrate with translated p50/p65 dimers</SCOPE> but instead comigrated with c-Rel/p65 dimers.

Antibodies against the NF-kappa B and Rel proteins and UV cross-linking studies revealed the presence of c-Rel and p65 and the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of p50 in the TF complex</SCOPE> and further showed that c-Rel/p65 heterodimers selectively bound to the TF kappa B-like site.

The NF-kappa B site at positions -206 to -195 of the IL-2 promoter was required but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sufficient for the Tat effect</SCOPE>.

Although little information as to what signal transduction pathways mediate NF-kappa B activation in monocytes-macrophages is available, our previous work indicated that classical protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes were <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> involved in the HIV-mediated NF-kappa B activation</SCOPE>.

In addition, cotransfection of a negative dominant molecule of PKC-zeta (PKC-zeta mut) with NF-kappa B-dependent reporter genes selectively inhibits the HIV- but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> phorbol myristate acetate- or lipopolysaccharide-mediated activation of NF-kappa B</SCOPE>.

A variety of other cells, including transformed erythroid precursors, do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> have IBR</SCOPE> but a factor referred to as IBF (68 to 70 kDa) that recognizes the same IBR sites.

In contrast, protein kinase C stimulation or RelA overexpression does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the activity of a human IL4 promoter containing a mouse P sequence, which is a higher-affinity site for NF-ATp and a lower-affinity site for RelA</SCOPE>.

This protein-protein interaction does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> require the simultaneous binding of Oct proteins to DNA</SCOPE>, and high resolution footprinting of the Oct-DNA interaction reveals that binding of BOB.1/OBF.1 to Oct1 or Oct2 does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> alter the interaction with DNA</SCOPE>.

BOB.1/OBF.1 can efficiently activate octamer-dependent promoters in fibroblasts; however, it <SCOPE><NEG>fails</NEG> to stimulate octamer-dependent enhancer activity</SCOPE>.

Consistent with the <SCOPE><NEG>failure</NEG> of full-length BOB.1/OBF.1 to stimulate octamer-dependent enhancer elements in non B cells</SCOPE>, the GAL4 fusions likewise only stimulate from a promoter-proximal position.

Although IL-10 alone did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce HIV-1 replication</SCOPE>, in the presence of TNF-alpha, IL-10 markedly enhanced virion production from a chronically infected promonocytic cell line (U1) and in acutely infected monocyte-derived macrophages.

Northern blot analysis as well as Ab blocking and cytokine secretion studies <SCOPE>indicated that <SCOPE>the induction of either endogenous TNF-alpha or IL-10 was <NEG>not</NEG> involved in the cooperativity, <NEG>nor</NEG> was an up-regulation of TNF-alpha receptors</SCOPE></SCOPE>.

The human B29 gene <SCOPE><NEG>lacks</NEG> either a TATA or a CAAT</SCOPE> box and transcription is initiated at multiple sites.

An inhibitory, &quot;dominant-negative,&quot; form of the calcineurin catalytic (A) subunit was prepared, which <SCOPE><NEG>lacks</NEG> the calmodulin-binding domain, autoinhibitory domain and most of its catalytic core</SCOPE> but possesses the regulatory (B) subunit binding domain.

<SCOPE>A mutant Tax protein deficient in transactivation of genes by the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway was <NEG>unable</NEG> to induce transcriptional activity of IL-1alpha promoter-CAT constructs</SCOPE>, but was rescued by exogenous provision of p65/p50 NF-kappaB.

By contrast, AM580 is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> effective as ATRA in modulating the expression of these differentiation markers in the HL-60 cell line and in freshly isolated granulocytes obtained from the peripheral blood of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients during the stable phase of the disease</SCOPE>.

The work reported here resolves, at the level of gene regulation, the controversy as to whether or not human monocytes/macrophages can produce nitric oxide (NO) when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), with or <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> co-stimulation by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)</SCOPE>.

Two explanations for hyporesponsiveness of the human iNOS promoter to LPS ± IFN-gamma were found: (1) multiple inactivating nucleotide substitutions in the human counterpart of the enhancer element that has been shown to regulate LPS/IFN-gamma induced expression of the mouse iNOS gene; and (2) and <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of one or more nuclear factors in human macrophages (e.g., an LPS-inducible nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel complex)</SCOPE>, that is (are) required for maximal expression of the gene.

These foci, which were preferentially found adjacent to nucleoli or at the nuclear periphery, did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> represent sites of active transcription or binding of GATA-1 to consensus sites in the beta-globin loci</SCOPE>.

The GATA-1 nuclear bodies differed from previously described nuclear structures and there was <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> co-localization with nuclear antigens involved in RNA processing or other ubiquitous (Spl, c-Jun and TBP) or haemopoietic (NF-E2) transcription factors</SCOPE>.

Costimulation of U1 cells with LPS plus GM-CSF resulted in the accumulation of steady-state levels of HIV RNA; however, only a weak induction of HIV long terminal repeat-driven transcription, <SCOPE>which was <NEG>not</NEG> associated with the activation of the cellular transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B</SCOPE>, was noted.

Costimulation of cells with LPS plus GM-CSF induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-8, IL-1 beta and IL-6, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> TNF-alpha</SCOPE>.

Nuclear factors from unstimulated, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> from activated cells</SCOPE>, bound a site, META(D-), adjacent to META(D+).

Authentic NFAT and NF-kappaB targets did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> compete for the META(D+) binding factor(s)</SCOPE>.

The SV40 core sequence competed for META(D+) binding factors, but META(D+) <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to compete for the complexes obtained with the SV40 probe</SCOPE>.

The regulation of collagenase expression is cell-type specific; bacterial LPS and zymosan, a yeast cell wall derivative, are potent inducers of collagenase expression in macrophages, but do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> alter fibroblast collagenase expression</SCOPE>.

Since <SCOPE>promoter elements controlling collagenase transcription in monocytic cells have <NEG>not</NEG> been previously defined</SCOPE>, we sought to delineate responsive cis-acting elements of the collagenase promoter in transiently transfected human (U937) and murine (J774) monocytic cell lines.

Mutagenesis of the activator protein-1 [AP-1] site at -72 abolished basal promoter activity and LPS/zymosan inducibility, while mutagenesis of an NF-kappaB-like site at -20 to -10 had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect</SCOPE>.

These data indicate that, in contrast to most LPS effects, AP-1, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> nuclear factor-kappaB</SCOPE>, mediates LPS induction of collagenase transcription in macrophagelike cells.

Transient expression of p16 in normal human lymphocytes caused arrest in G1, but was <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> effect on the cell growth of MOLT-4 and CEM cells</SCOPE>, although all of them express functional retinoblastoma protein.

Mice <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> Rel</SCOPE> are defective in mitogenic activation of B and T lymphocytes and display impaired humoral immunity.

In contrast, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulated Rel-/- T cells, which <SCOPE><NEG>fail</NEG> to proliferate</SCOPE>, make little or <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> detectable cytokines</SCOPE>.

Exogenous IL-2, which restitutes the proliferative response of the anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-treated Rel-/- T cells, restores production of IL-5, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> IL-3 and GM-CSF expression</SCOPE> to approximately normal levels.

Galectin-3 is widely distributed in various tissues and cell types and is expressed in many leukocytes, <SCOPE><NEG>with the notable exception of</NEG> B and T lymphocytes</SCOPE>.

We now report that galectin-3 is abundantly expressed in a number of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I-infected human T cell lines, including F6T, HUT 102, K3T, MT-2, and SLB-I, but is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> expressed in non-HTLV-I-infected T cell lines such as Jurkat, CEM, and MOLT-4</SCOPE>.

Nonmitogenic T cell stimulation did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> result in appearance of NF-MATp35</SCOPE>.

Efficient transcription and replication of simian immunodeficiency virus in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of NF-kappaB and Sp1 binding elements</SCOPE>.

All mutants, including one extensively mutagenized strain entirely <SCOPE><NEG>missing</NEG> the NF-kappaB and four Spl binding elements</SCOPE>, replicated with wild-type kinetics and to a wild-type level in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures in 50 to 100% of the experiments.

<SCOPE>Reversions or additional mutations were <NEG>not</NEG> detected in the U3 and R regions of proviral DNA from CEMxl74 cells infected with the SIVmac239 mutants</SCOPE>.

Analysis of long terminal repeat-driven secreted alkaline phosphatase activity in transient assays showed that, unlike human immunodeficiency virus type 1, the SIV long terminal repeat possesses an enhancer region just upstream of the NF-kappaB element which maintains significant levels of basal transcription in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of NF-kappaB and Sp1 sites</SCOPE>.

However, it remains unclear how this viral protein induces a persistent <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> transient NF-kappaB response</SCOPE>.

BCR-induced increases in CD44 mRNA expression and transcription levels are shown to occur in EGR1-expressing but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in nonexpressing subclones of the B-cell line WEHI-231</SCOPE>.

A protein footprint was visible over this region of the c-myb 5&apos; flanking sequence in activated T cells but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in unactivated T cells</SCOPE>.

An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with nuclear extract from activated T cells and an oligonucleotide of this binding site demonstrated a new protein-DNA complex, referred to as CMAT for c-myb in activated T cells; this complex was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> present in unactivated T cells</SCOPE>.

In addition, an antibody against NFAT did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> cross-react with the CMAT protein</SCOPE>.

CNI-1493 blocked <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increases in the expression of TNF mRNA <NEG>nor</NEG> the translocation of nuclear factor NF-kappa B to the nucleus in macrophages activated by 15 min of LPS stimulation</SCOPE>, indicating that CNI-1493 does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> interfere with early NF-kappa B-mediated transcriptional regulation of TNF</SCOPE>.

Specific DNA protein complex formation was observed with the probes from the beta-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with the ISRE oligonucleotide probe</SCOPE>, when cell extracts from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were investigated.

Since <SCOPE>the cells were <NEG>not</NEG> treated with cytokines before the nuclear proteins were extracted</SCOPE>, we conclude that these factors are constitutively activated in vivo.

We have shown that 1-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine hydrochloride (ML-9), an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase, induces differentiation of monocytoid leukemia cell lines U937 and THP-1 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> of myeloblastic leukemic ML-1 cell or erythroleukemia K562 cells</SCOPE>.

ML-9 had little or <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on the morphology of U937 cells</SCOPE> but increased the expression of monocyte-macrophage lineage-associated surface antigen, CD14, to some extent.

Irreversible terminal differentiation induced by VD3 is associated with down regulation of the expression of c-myc and upregulation of the expression of c-fos and c-jun, but ML-9 did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the expression of these oncogenes appreciably</SCOPE>.

it became irreversible, however, upon simultaneous treatment with dexamethasone and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), which did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce differentiation of U937 cells</SCOPE> but caused growth arrest of the cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle.

LPS-stimulated monocytes showed an increased expression of p105 mRNA, the precursor of the p50 subunit of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), while <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect was noticed on the expression of p65 mRNA</SCOPE>.

In contrast, IFN-gamma priming did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the expression of p105 transcripts</SCOPE> but enhanced the expression of p65 mRNA (two-fold).

However, the combined stimulation did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> result in enhanced p50 and p65 protein expression</SCOPE>.

The effects of IFN-gamma on the transcription factors were specific, since <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> change was observed in the expression of NF-IL-6 or I kappa B alpha, the inhibitor of NF-kappa B</SCOPE>.

Most studies on the expression of these proteins in relation to the cell cycle have been performed at the mRNA level, and therefore do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> give direct information about the presence of the proteins during the cell cycle</SCOPE>.

We found nuclear p62c-fos, p39c-jun, and AP-1 binding activity throughout the cell cycle both in HL60 cells and in PHA-stimulated PBL, and we postulate that these proteins are required throughout the cell cycle and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> transiently in the G0 to G1 transition</SCOPE> as previous mRNA studies have indicated.

Nuclei of unstimulated PBL from different donors expressed p62c-fos and p39c-jun, but <SCOPE>AP-1 was <NEG>not</NEG> detected in the majority of samples</SCOPE>.

However, <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> cytoplasmic p62c-fos was detected in unstimulated PBL</SCOPE>, although in some cases cytoplasmic p39c-jun was detected, suggesting that subcellular compartmentalization of these proteinsmay occur under certain circumstances.

<SCOPE>H2O2-induced NF-kappaB activation in Wurzburg cells was <NEG>not</NEG> influenced by the presence of extracellular EGTA</SCOPE> but was totally inhibited in cells that were loaded with esterified EGTA.

In Jurkat cells that are <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sensitive to H2O2-induced NF-kappaB activation</SCOPE>, H2O2 potentiated NF-kappaB activation in the presence of sustained high [Ca2+]i following thapsigargin treatment.

We found that this latently infected cell line with heat shock at 42 degrees C for 2 h resulted in a high level of HIV-1 production <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> addition of any cytokines</SCOPE>.

The expression of p45 mRNA in the neutrophils declined rapidly after transfer of the cells to in vitro culture and G-CSF could <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sustain the expression from the down-regulation</SCOPE>, suggesting the E2 may also participate in the regulation of neutrophil-specific gene expression.

However, the inducible degradation of p105 is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> coupled with the generation of p50</SCOPE>.

In addition to finding hLH-2 expression in all cases of CML, expression was observed in lymphoid malignancies and myeloid cell lines, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in primary cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia</SCOPE>.

We show that both delta383 and delta99 specifically enhance expression of cat for plasmids containing a human adult globin (HBB) promoter, whereas <SCOPE>expression of similar constructs using human fetal (A gamma-) globin (HBG1) or simian virus 40 (SV40) promoters is <NEG>not</NEG> enhanced</SCOPE>.

When the HTLV-1 tax gene was expressed or phorbol myristake acetate-A23187 stimulation was used, ICSAT expression was induced in Jurkat cells which otherwise do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> express ICSAT</SCOPE>.

Although <SCOPE>GM-CSF does <NEG>not</NEG> appear to be essential for normal hemopoiesis</SCOPE>, overexpression of GM-CSF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some diseases such as myeloid leukemia and chronic inflammation.

Finally, GM3 greatly reduced the concentration of endogenous GM-CSF mRNA induced by different stimuli in Jurkat T cells but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect interleukin 3 mRNA levels in the same cells</SCOPE>.

Unlike many hematopoietin receptors, the IL-10R did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> detectably activate STAT5</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>This regulation could <NEG>not</NEG> be appreciably modified by enhanced expression of STAT proteins</SCOPE>.

Finally, we show that the B cell coactivator OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B is only expressed in B cells and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in myeloid cells</SCOPE>, and that OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B can transactivate the PU.1 promoter in HeLa and myeloid cells.

Although GABP expression is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> restricted to the hematopoietic lineage</SCOPE>, its interaction with other specific factors may contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the gammac gene.

However, some peculiar differences were observed between the TEC, either IFN-gamma-induced or <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>, and the constitutive B cells.

DeltaSpi-B product was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> able to bind DNA</SCOPE> and was recovered in cytoplasmic cellular extracts.

<SCOPE>The IL-10 effect on c-fos expression was <NEG>not</NEG> blocked by polymyxin B</SCOPE>.

The inhibition is exerted specifically on the NF-kappa B/Rel activation induced by mAb OKT3, and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> that produced by PMA</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>Soluble factors do <NEG>not</NEG> appear to be involved in the mechanism of inhibition</SCOPE>.

On the other hand, <SCOPE>the up-regulation of CD80 Ag, found on monocytes obtained from PBMC incubated with OKT3, is <NEG>not</NEG> detected after addition of IL-10</SCOPE>, and the anti-CD28 mAb CLB-CD28/1 restores the NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in IL-10-inhibited lymphocytes.

Therefore, the NF-kappa B/Rel inhibition might be ascribed to a <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of cooperation between accessory cells and T lymphocytes</SCOPE>, resulting from down-regulation of a costimulatory molecule, such as CD80, produced by IL-10 on activated monocytes.

<SCOPE>Cytotoxicity was <NEG>not</NEG> demonstrated at these concentrations</SCOPE>.

Add-back experiments with either cytokines (IL-2 or IL-6), LTB4 or conditioned media <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to restore the proliferative response in the presence of tepoxalin</SCOPE>.

In comparison, isolated nuclei of human lymphocytes in which <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> need for the expression of this gene exists</SCOPE>, show barely hybridization signals.

Correspondingly, RNase treatment had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on hybridization pattern at all</SCOPE>.

Alpha 4 beta 1 (CD49d/CD29) integrin costimulation of human T cells enhances transcription factor and cytokine induction in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of altered sensitivity to anti-CD3 stimulation</SCOPE>.

alpha 4 beta 1 ligation alone had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on transcription factor binding</SCOPE>.

In contrast to freshly isolated T cells, in vitro-cultured T cells did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> require costimulation for cytokine secretion in response to anti-CD3 alone</SCOPE>.

Therefore, costimulation by alpha 4 beta 1 ligands was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> due to stabilization of the interaction of the cells with its substrate</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>The age-related decline in induction of NF kappa B could <NEG>not</NEG> be attributed to alteration in the composition of subunits</SCOPE>, p50 and p65 were found to be the predominant subunits of induced NF kappa B in T cells from young as well as elderly donors.

Tax does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> bind directly to DNA</SCOPE> but rather deregulates the activity of cellular transcription factors.

The cytokines IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and LPS, although <SCOPE><NEG>unable</NEG> to induce sialoadhesin expression by themselves</SCOPE>, were able to enhance GC-mediated induction of sialoadhesin.

The regulation of sialoadhesin expression was mediated by the GC receptor, and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by mineralocorticoid receptor</SCOPE>, as shown by inhibition experiments with specific antagonists.

The effects of selenium were specific for NF-kappa B, since <SCOPE>the activity of the transcription factor AP-1 was <NEG>not</NEG> suppressed</SCOPE>.

In addition, inhibition of mRNA synthesis with actinomycin D indicated that DOX induced an increased stability of PBGD and GATA-1 mRNAs, whereas ACLA did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the half-lives of these mRNAs</SCOPE>.

Finally, GATA-1 protein level was shown to be increased in ACLA-treated but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in DOX-treated cells</SCOPE>.

To overcome this problem, we have exploited the observation that activated human T cell blasts can be stimulated via the CD28 surface molecule in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of antigenic challenge</SCOPE>; thus, we have been able to observe the response of normal T cells to CD28 activation in isolation.

Using this system, we observed that CD28 stimulation by B7-transfected CHO cells induced a proliferative response in T cells that was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> accompanied by measurable IL-2 production</SCOPE>.

However, subsequent analysis of transcription factor generation revealed that B7 stimulation induced both activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) complexes, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> NF-AT</SCOPE>.

In contrast, engagement of the TCR by class II MHC/superantigen, either with or <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> CD28 ligation</SCOPE>, resulted in the induction of NF-AT, AP-1, and NF-kappaB as well as IL-2 production.

This revealed that NF-kappaB generation was sensitive to chloroquine, an inhibitor of acidic sphingomyelinase, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>Second messenger up-regulation of androgen receptor gene transcription is <NEG>absent</NEG> in androgen insensitive human prostatic carcinoma cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145</SCOPE>.

After 20 h of stimulation with 8-bromo-cAMP, AR mRNA was upregulated in LNCaP but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in either PC-3 or DU-145 cell lines</SCOPE>.

IL-4 had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> significant effect on HIV reverse transcription</SCOPE>.

IL-13 had similar effects on CD11b and CD13, but <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on CD26</SCOPE>.

CD15 cross-linking also concomitantly increased interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA, while <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> apparent change was observed in the levels of beta-actin mRNA</SCOPE>, indicating specificity.

Nuclear extracts of anti-CD15 cross-linked cells demonstrated enhanced levels of the transcriptional factor activator protein-1, minimally changed nuclear factor-kappa B, and did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect SV40 promoter specific protein-1</SCOPE>.

V3-BH10, which consists of 42 amino acids and has a loop structure, suppressed IL-2-driven proliferation of all IL-2-dependent cells [Kit225, ED-40515(+), KT-3, 7-day PHA-blasts, and fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells] tested, whereas it did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> suppress the cell growth of IL-2-independent cell lines (Hut102, Molt-4, and Jurkat)</SCOPE>.

This suppressive effect was also seen in IL-2-driven cell growth of CD8-positive lymphocytes purified from 7-day PHA-blasts, indicating that <SCOPE>CD4 molecules were <NEG>not</NEG> required for the suppression</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>Neither</NEG> chromatin condensation <NEG>nor</NEG> DNA fragmentation was detected in Kit225 cells cultured with V3-BH10 and IL-2</SCOPE>.

V3-BH10 <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> blocked radiolabeled IL-2 binding to IL-2 receptors <NEG>nor</NEG> affected tyrosyl phosphorylation of several cellular proteins (p120, p98, p96, p54, and p38), which is immediately induced by IL-2 stimulation</SCOPE>.

On the other hand, FCM produced in the presence of indomethacin does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> inhibit NF-kappaB activation by LPS</SCOPE>.

IL-4 is secreted by activated Th2 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> Th1 cells</SCOPE> and plays a major role in the immune response by modulating the differentiation of naive Th cells toward the Th2 phenotype.

In contrast, <SCOPE>POS-1 was <NEG>not</NEG> found in nuclear extracts of human Th1 clones</SCOPE>.

Inhibition of TNF-alpha production by THP-1-hGH-transfected cells cultured in the presence of LPS is dependent on a selective pathway, since <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> inhibition of TNF-alpha production was observed when cells were cultured in the presence of PMA</SCOPE>.

The capacity of GH to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-alpha production by monocytes <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> altering other pathways leading to TNF-alpha production</SCOPE> may be of potential relevance in septic shock, since GH is available for clinical use.

Whereas T cells from young subjects stimulated with cross-linked anti-CD3epsilon mAb OKT3 plus PMA or with the lectin PHA plus PMA demonstrated considerable increases in c-Fos protein expression, the expression of c-Fos but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> c-Jun</SCOPE> was markedly reduced in stimulated T cells from certain elderly subjects.

In the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of a cloned MIBP1 gene for further studies</SCOPE>, we hypothesize that RFX1 acts with MIBP1 to negatively regulate the core promoter activity through the NRE gamma site.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift analysis we demonstrated that the promoter region spanning base pairs -1 to -275, which contains several putative binding sites for transcription factors, is bound by nuclear factors Sp1 and IRBP but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by C/EBPs</SCOPE>.

Analysis of the sequence immediately upstream from the transcription initiation site (TIS) showed <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> canonical TATA or CAAT elements</SCOPE>, however an initiator element commonly found in TATA-less promoters encompassed the TIS.

Mutational analysis showed that optimal transcriptional activity required the GATA sequence at position -24, and gel-shift assays further showed that the GATA-2 transcription factor, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> GATA-1</SCOPE>, bound to this region of the PECAM-1 promoter.

The putative promoter area is similar to those of several other myeloid-cell-specific genes in that it contains <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> TATAAA box</SCOPE> but has a number of purine-rich stretches with multiple sites for the factors of the Ets family of transcriptional regulators.

Characterization of a mutant cell line that does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> activate NF-kappaB in response to multiple stimuli</SCOPE>.

In this study, we have characterized a cellular mutant, the 70/Z3-derived 1.3E2 murine pre-B cell line, that does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> activate NF-kappaB in response to several stimuli</SCOPE>.

We demonstrate that upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide, Taxol, phorbol myristate acetate, interleukin-1, or double-stranded RNA, <SCOPE>I kappaB alpha is <NEG>not</NEG> degraded</SCOPE>, as a result of an <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of induced phosphorylation on serines 32 and 36</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>Neither</NEG> a mutation in I kappaB alpha <NEG>nor</NEG> a mutation in p50 or relA, the two major subunits of NF-kappaB in this cell line, accounts for this phosphorylation defect</SCOPE>.

Analysis of the redox status of 1.3E2 does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> reveal any difference from wild-type 70Z/3</SCOPE>.

We also report that the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-derived Tax trans-activator induces NF-kappaB activity in 1.3E2, suggesting that this viral protein does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> operate via the defective pathway</SCOPE>.

Finally, we show that <SCOPE>two other I kappaB molecules, I kappaB beta and the recently identified I kappaB epsilon, are <NEG>not</NEG> degraded in the 1.3E2 cell line following stimulation</SCOPE>.

Transcription mediated by NFAT is highly inducible in effector CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in Th1 cells</SCOPE>.

In contrast to activated pTh cells, <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> eTh1 <NEG>nor</NEG> eTh2 cells produced significant IL-2 upon stimulation</SCOPE>, but the high levels of NFAT transcriptional activities directly correlate with the IL-4 production induced in response to antigen stimulation in eTh2 cells.

These data suggest that activated NFAT is involved in the effector function of eTh2 cells and that the <SCOPE><NEG>failure</NEG> of eTh1 cells to produce IL-4 in response to an antigen</SCOPE> is due, at least partially, to a <SCOPE><NEG>failure</NEG> to induce high-level transcription of the IL-4 gene by NFAT</SCOPE>.

HIV infection of fresh monocytes <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to induce p50/p65 as seen in MDMs</SCOPE>.

Treatment of a T-lymphocytic cell line with micromolar concentrations of HOCl promoted the appearance of transcription factor NF-kappaB (the heterodimer p50/p65) in the nucleus of the cells, even in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of de novo protein synthesis</SCOPE>.

However, <SCOPE>induction of NF-AT, which has the same signaling requirements as c-Rel induction, was <NEG>not</NEG> inhibited by PF</SCOPE>.

Among genes that respond to these transcription factors, IL-2 mRNA induction was suppressed by PF, whereas <SCOPE>IL-2R(alpha) chain mRNA induction was <NEG>not</NEG> affected</SCOPE>.

In contrast with the observation in T cells, <SCOPE>c-Rel induction was <NEG>not</NEG> blocked by PF in B cells</SCOPE>.

Dexamethasone (10(-8) M) repressed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) production by 75% in the wild-type fragment but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in a deletion mutant <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> the 19-bp site</SCOPE></SCOPE>.

TRAMP-induced cell death is inhibited by an inhibitor of ICE-like proteases, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by Bcl-2</SCOPE>.

In addition, <SCOPE>TRAMP does <NEG>not</NEG> appear to interact with any of the known apoptosis-inducing ligands of the TNF family</SCOPE>.

By contrast, <SCOPE>these effects were <NEG>not</NEG> observed upon pulse-treatment with 6 microM ICRF-193</SCOPE>.

We have reported previously that a nuclear NF-kappa B activity was present in freshly extracted human thymocytes in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of in vitro treatment of these cells</SCOPE>.

We generated a point mutant of ZEBRA, Z(S186A), <SCOPE>that was <NEG>not</NEG> impaired in its ability to activate transcription</SCOPE>; however, this mutation abolished its ability to initiate the viral lytic cascade.

The mutant, containing a serine-to-alanine substitution in the DNA-binding domain of the protein, bound to several known ZEBRA-binding sites and activated transcription from reporters bearing known ZEBRA-responsive promoters but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> disrupt latency in EBV-infected cell lines</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> degradation of p105 and p100 inhibitors was observed under these conditions</SCOPE>.

However, <SCOPE>the NF-kappaB activation pathway involving the acidic sphingomyelinase of the endolysosomial membrane did <NEG>not</NEG> seem to participate in the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in U937 cells</SCOPE>.

In contrast to the MF individuals where <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect was seen</SCOPE>, transendothelial migration of 48-hr filarial antigen stimulated T-cells from LP individuals was significantly (P = 0.01) greater than migration of 48-hr media-stimulated T-cells.

A dominant-negative mutant of NF-kappaB p50 that binds DNA but <SCOPE><NEG>fails</NEG> to interact with Ets proteins</SCOPE> inhibits the synergistic activation of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 enhancers by NF-kappaB (p50 + p65) and Ets-1, suggesting that physical interaction between Ets and NF-kappaB proteins is required for the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 enhancers.

In the tumor samples, expression of LAZ3/BCL6 was observed in 68% of all B cell NHL and <SCOPE><NEG>none</NEG> of the non-B lymphomas</SCOPE>.

Hence, the expression of LAZ3/BCL6 does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> correlate to malignancy</SCOPE>, but reflects the origin of B cells from the germinal centers.

Oncogenic forms of NOTCH1 <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> either the primary binding site for RBP-Jkappa or nuclear localization sequences</SCOPE> retain the ability to associate with RBP-Jkappa and activate transcription.

Unlike full-sized NOTCH1, two such truncated forms of the protein either <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> a major portion of the extracellular domain (DeltaE)</SCOPE> or consisting only of the intracellular domain (ICN) were found to activate transcription in cultured cells, presumably through RBP-Jkappa response elements within DNA.

Unexpectedly, <SCOPE>a second, stronger RBP-Jkappa-binding site, which lies within the intracellular domain close to the transmembrane region and significantly augments association with RBP-Jkappa, was <NEG>not</NEG> needed for oncogenesis or for transcriptional activation</SCOPE>.

While ICN appeared primarily in the nucleus, DeltaE localized to cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes, suggesting that intranuclear localization is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> essential for oncogenesis or transcriptional activation</SCOPE>.

RESULTS: <SCOPE>Certain aspects of TCR responses such as the induction of transcriptional activity of AP1 and serum response factor were <NEG>not</NEG> affected by expression of the mutant forms of PI 3-kinase</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>These effects of PI 3-kinase were <NEG>not</NEG> mediated by previously identified PI 3-kinase effectors, such as protein kinase B, a positive regulator of PI 3-kinase, or the GTPase Rac</SCOPE>, and are therefore likely to involve a novel, as yet unknown, effector molecule.

To assess whether this inhibition was mediated via modulation of the cellular transcription factor, NF-kappa B, we carried out gel shift analysis on nuclear extracts prepared under different conditions of cell stimulation in the presence or <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of ascorbate, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), or zidovudine (AZT)</SCOPE>.

In contrast, <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> ascorbate <NEG>nor</NEG> AZT affected NF-kappa B activity under all three induction conditions in the ACH-2 cell line</SCOPE>.

Ascorbate and AZT also had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on NF-kappa B activation following TNF-alpha- or PMA-induced stimulation of U1 promonocytic cells</SCOPE>.

These results suggest that <SCOPE>the molecular mechanism of HIV inhibition by ascorbate is <NEG>not</NEG> mediated via NF-kappa B inhibition</SCOPE>, unlike that seen with other antioxidants.

Within the erythroid lineage, runt expression is biphasic, clearly present in the erythroblasts of early blood islands and of the fetal liver, but <SCOPE><NEG>absent</NEG> in the adult</SCOPE>.

Cell-to-cell contact activation of NF-kappaB was only partially inhibited by 100 microM pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and <SCOPE>was <NEG>not</NEG> correlated with a significant decrease of cellular inhibitor kappaB alpha</SCOPE>.

NF-kappaB nuclear activation was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> detectable before 1 h after cell contact</SCOPE> and was dependent on protein synthesis.

HIV does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> replicate in naive CD4 T cells stimulated with CD3/CD28</SCOPE>.

In this report, we demonstrate that the T cell tropic strain of HIV, LAI, does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> replicate in naive CD4 T cells stimulated by cross-linking CD3 and CD28</SCOPE>.

Remixing of purified T cells showed that naive T cells do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> suppress LAI replication in memory T cells</SCOPE> and that memory T cells do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> restore LAI expression in naive T cells</SCOPE>.

The suppression of productive LAI replication in naive T cells is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> due to differential expression of viral coreceptors, <NEG>nor</NEG> is it due to inhibition of activation of the important HIV transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1</SCOPE>.

Contrary to the results in Jurkat cells, PDTC did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF kappaB activation in astrocytes</SCOPE>; instead PDTC itself induces NF kappaB activation in astrocytes, and this may be related to scavenging of endogenously produced NO by the PDTC iron complex.

NF kappaB activation in glia from mice <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> nNOS</SCOPE> responds more rapidly to PDTC compared with astrocytes from wild-type mice.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter activity stimulated by cross-linking of CD2, TCR/CD3, and CD28 with antibodies was significantly reduced by transient expression of an Itk mutant <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> the kinase activity</SCOPE>.

Although CD40 <SCOPE><NEG>lacks</NEG> intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity</SCOPE>, its ligation induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which is necessary for several CD40-mediated events.

The tumour associated cell surface antigen A6H is costimulatory for human CD4+ but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> CD8+ T cells</SCOPE>.

Unexpectedly, the CD8+ T-cell subpopulation <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to respond</SCOPE>.

CD4+ T cells costimulated with the A6H mAb upregulated CD80, CD86, CD71, interleukin-2 (IL-2)R alpha, IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma, while <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> corresponding up-regulation of these cell surface molecules was seen in CD8+ T cells</SCOPE>.

Co-ligation of the A6H antigen and the CD3 complex induced expression of the transcription factor AP-1 in CD4+ T cells, whereas <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> increase in NF-kappa B and octamer-binding (Oct) proteins was seen compared to T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 alone</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> induction of AP-1 was seen in A6H costimulated CD8+ T cells</SCOPE>.

Structure and function analysis of the human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen promoter: evidence for the role of Sp1 and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> of c-Myb or PU.1</SCOPE> in myelomonocytic lineage-specific expression.

However, analysis of deletion mutants localized nearly all of the promoter activity to a short region (-73 to -16) that did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> include the cluster of c-Myb sites</SCOPE>.

Only a small region (-35 to +22) including the Sp1 element and transcription start site, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the PU.1 site</SCOPE> was footprinted.

Quantification of vitamin D receptor mRNA by competitive polymerase chain reaction in PBMC: <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of correspondence with common allelic variants</SCOPE>.

To validate the method, we made use of earlier receptor binding studies indicating that normal human monocytes and activated, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> resting</SCOPE>, lymphocytes expressed the VDR.

We conclude that VDR polymorphism does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the abundance of the VDR mRNA</SCOPE>.

IFN-gamma-primed lung fibroblasts costimulate T lymphocyte proliferation utilizing CD40, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the well-studied costimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2</SCOPE>.

Triggering of HLA class II antigens by the anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody (mAb) L243 significantly (P &lt; 0.05) and differentially enhanced the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells Ri-I, Ci-I, and Sc-I, which are at a distinct stage of B-cell differentiation, and by the more mature Burkitt lymphoma cell Raji; in contrast, it did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce TNF-alpha release by the pre-B leukemia cells Nalm-6 and BV173</SCOPE>.

Secreted TNF-alpha mediated the enhancement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding activity; in fact, the triggering of HLA-DR antigens in the presence of antihuman TNF-alpha-neutralizing antibodies did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> upregulate NF-kappa B and AP-1</SCOPE>.

In contrast, released TNF-alpha was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> responsible for the homotypic aggregation of Ri-I, Ci-I, Sc-I, and Raji cells induced by mAb L243</SCOPE>, and it did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the proliferation of B cells investigated</SCOPE>.

Altogether, our data demonstrate that: (a) the ability of B cells to release TNF-alpha after triggering of HLA-DR antigens depends on their stage of differentiation; (b) levels of released TNF-alpha seem to correlate with the stage of B-cell maturation but do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> correlate with the amounts of cell surface HLA-DR antigens</SCOPE>; (c) secreted TNF-alpha regulates the levels of expression of NF-kappa B and AP-1 by an autocrine loop; and (d) intracellular signals mediating TNF-alpha release by B cells are distinct from those regulating homotypic aggregation and proliferation.

A deletion construct that contains a NF-kappa B site but is <SCOPE><NEG>missing</NEG> the multiple response region</SCOPE> demonstrated a continued increase in IL-6 luciferase activity in LPS-stimulated CMV transfected cells.

The increase in IL-6 luciferase activity occurs in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of the multiple response region</SCOPE>, the area of the IL-6 promoter responsive to IL-1, TNF alpha, cyclic amp, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

In contrast, <SCOPE>NK activity was <NEG>not</NEG> affected by pretreatment of the effector cells with the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal which selectively inhibits NF-kappa B activation</SCOPE>.

Homodimerization of the human interleukin 4 receptor alpha chain induces Cepsilon germline transcripts in B cells in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of the interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain</SCOPE>.

Induction of Cepsilon germline transcripts by IL-4 in B cells that <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> the gammac chain</SCOPE> may involve signaling via the IL-13R.

The <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of steroid binding of HBD mutants with the Thr729-Leu765 sequence deleted</SCOPE> [Jalaguier, Mesnier, Leger and Auzou (1996) J.Steroid Biochem.Mol.Biol.57, 43-50] supports this hypothesis.

A role in thymic maturation for factors of the NF-kappaB family has long been suspected, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> yet proven</SCOPE>.

The results demonstrate that alterations in NF kappaB family proteins, specifically the <SCOPE><NEG>failure</NEG> of p65 translocation to the nucleus</SCOPE>, occur earlier and more frequently than the decrease in zeta-chain.

However, the experimentally derived B-lymphoblastoid cell line, clone 13, expresses high levels of HLADQ in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of HLA-DR and HLA-DP</SCOPE>, despite its mapping by complementation analysis to this group.

It was possible that one of the clone 13 CIITA alleles bore a mutation that allowed HLA-DQ, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> HLA-DR or -DP transcription</SCOPE>.

We report here that ectopic expression of CIITA cDNAs derived by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from clone 13 do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> restore expression of HLA-DQ in another CIITA-deficient cell line, RJ2.2.5</SCOPE>.

In addition, <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> CIITA protein is detectable in clone 13 nuclear extracts</SCOPE>.

A TBP mutant defective in interaction with TBP-associated factor TAFII250 also <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to mediate transactivation through the CIITA activation domain</SCOPE>.

The other, CIITA, encodes a large protein with a defined acidic transcriptional activation domain; this protein does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> interact with DNA</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, these plasmids were <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> active in RJ2.2.5, an in vitro mutagenized derivative of Raji in which both copies of CIITA are defective</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, studies carried out using H7, a protein kinase A/protein kinase C inhibitor, blocked c-fos induction, whereas <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect was observed with bisindolylmaleimide, a specific protein kinase C inhibitor</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> modification of c-myc expression could be detected on treatment with histamine or its analogues</SCOPE>.

In addition, dibutyryl cAMP inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, whereas histamine <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to affect proliferation and differentiation of U937 cells</SCOPE>.

These results indicate that histamine activates several mechanisms involved in the induction of differentiation, such as cAMP and c-fos production, but <SCOPE><NEG>fails</NEG> to promote differentiation of U937 cells, apparently due to the rapid desensitization of H2 receptors</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that <SCOPE>binding of several B cell-specific transcription factors, essential for IgH 3&apos; enhancer activity, is <NEG>lacking</NEG></SCOPE>, which may explain 3&apos; enhancer inactivity, although the binding of repressors cannot be excluded.

The common gamma-chain (gamma(c)) is a functional component of the IL-4R, yet cells <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> gamma(c)</SCOPE> are able to respond to IL-4.

This has led to the suggestion that a surrogate gamma&apos;-chain, which can interact with the IL-4R alpha chain to mediate signaling, is expressed on cells <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> gamma(c)</SCOPE>.

An alternative possibility is that in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of gamma(c)</SCOPE>, the IL-4R alpha chain is able to transduce signals by homodimerization.

However, <SCOPE>tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK-3, which associates with gamma(c), is <NEG>not</NEG> induced by SCF in these cells</SCOPE>.

Together, these data demonstrate that the IL-4R alpha cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to activate JAK-1 and STAT6 and to induce expression of IL-4 target genes, thus identifying a mechanism by which IL-4 signaling can proceed in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of JAK-3 and gamma(c)</SCOPE>.

Stimulation of purified T lymphocytes by a combination of monoclonal antibodies directed at CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules gives rise to a long lasting proliferation in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of accessory cells</SCOPE>.

Cyclin A was observed after 4 days of costimulation with anti CD2 + CD28 whereas stimulation by anti CD2 or anti CD28 alone was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> effective</SCOPE>.

Consistent with theses results, nuclear extracts prepared from quiescent cells formed a specific complex with this element, whereas extracts prepared from cells treated with anti CD2 + anti CD28 <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to do so after cells entered a proliferative state</SCOPE>.

IL-10 inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced ICAM-1 expression was apparent as early as 3 hours and was blocked by an anti-IL-10 antibody but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by an isotype-matched control antibody</SCOPE>.

Nuclear run-on transcription assays showed that IL-10 inhibited the rate of IFN-gamma-induced transcription of the ICAM-1 gene, and mRNA stability studies showed that IL-10 did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> alter the half-life of IFN-gamma-induced ICAM-1 message</SCOPE>.

However, IL-10 did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect IFN-gamma-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1alpha or alter STAT-1alpha binding to the IFN-gamma response element (IRE) in the ICAM-1 promoter</SCOPE>.

In fact, mAb L243 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the staphylococcal superantigens</SCOPE>, staphylococcal exotoxin toxic shock syndrome toxin-I or staphylococcal enterotoxin B, regulate the NF-kappa B binding activity.

We investigated the transactivation potential of Stat6 and found that it is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> restricted to lymphocytes</SCOPE>.

Our previous studies showed that the exposure of human monocytes to E. chaffeensis induces the expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-8, and IL-10 genes in vitro but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 mRNAs</SCOPE>.

Fab fragment of anti-E. chaffeensis immunoglobulin G complexed with E. chaffeensis did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce any of these three cytokines</SCOPE>, indicating that ehrlichial binding is required for IL-1beta mRNA expression and that binding of the immune complex to the Fc gamma receptor is required for TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA expression and enhanced IL-1beta mRNA expression.

In monocytes, the virus was bound to the surface <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> being internalized</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> virus replication and <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> transcription of the Ad2 early genes was observed in either of the cells</SCOPE></SCOPE>.

In macrophages, a slight enhancement of TNF-alpha production was seen, whereas <SCOPE>IL-1 beta was <NEG>not</NEG> detected</SCOPE>.

The data indicate that cellular genes might be activated by Ad2 virus infection in nonpermissive cells where <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> viral gene products could be detected</SCOPE>.

The CRE and kappaB3 sites in region II together conferred strong LPS responsiveness to a heterologous promoter, whereas individually they <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to provide transcriptional activation</SCOPE>.

In resting Raji cells, little to <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> binding to the X2 box was observed</SCOPE>.

As determined by transient expression and RNA analyses, the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) also increased rates of transcription from the wild-type DRA promoter but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> from a DRA promoter bearing clustered point mutations in the X2 box</SCOPE>.

In contrast, IFN-alpha/beta rescued T cell clones from apoptosis <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> active proliferation</SCOPE>, and expression of apoptosis-associated proteins tested so far was unaffected.

It is known that the expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in adult T cell leukemia(ATL) cells are high, whereas those in T-lymphoid cells are <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

Individual mutation of the DBF or AP3-L site as well as the double mutation AP-1(III)/AP3-L did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect HIV-1 replication compared to that of the wild-type virus</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> RNA-packaging defect could be measured for any of the mutant viruses as determined by quantification of their HIV genomic RNA</SCOPE>.

The ability of ascorbate to enhance cytoplasmic inhibitory IkBalpha protein degradation correlates completely with its capacity to induce NF-kappaB binding to DNA and to potentiate NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter in TNF-alpha-stimulated Jurkat cells but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in cells stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin</SCOPE>.

AFR behaves like ascorbate, while DHA and ascorbate phosphate do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation</SCOPE>.

Bacterially expressed RP1 protein revealed specific binding to wild-type but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> to mutated APC protein</SCOPE>.

While several lines of investigation have suggested that NF-kappaB/Rel family members make up the CD28 response complex transcription factor, other work has <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> supported this conclusion</SCOPE>.

Recent studies suggest that the CD28 response element (CD28RE) does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> function independently</SCOPE> but works instead in conjunction with the adjacent promoter proximal AP-1-binding site and this hypothesis is confirmed here.

Eed binds to K protein through a domain in its N terminus, but interestingly, <SCOPE>this domain is <NEG>not</NEG> found in the Drosophila Esc</SCOPE>.

APLs with the PML-RAR alpha or the PLZF-RAR alpha fusion protein are phenotypically indistinguishable except that they differ in their sensitivity to retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation: PML-RAR alpha blasts are sensitive to RA and patients enter disease remission after RA treatment, while patients with PLZF-RAR alpha do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

We here report that (i) like PML-RAR alpha expression, PLZF-RAR alpha expression blocks terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cell lines (U937 and HL-60) in response to different stimuli (vitamin D3, transforming growth factor beta1, and dimethyl sulfoxide); (ii) PML-RAR alpha, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> PLZF-RAR alpha</SCOPE>, increases RA sensitivity of hematopoietic precursor cells and restores RA sensitivity of RA-resistant hematopoietic cells; (iii) PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha have similar RA binding affinities; and (iv) PML-RAR alpha enhances the RA response of RA target genes (those for RAR beta, RAR gamma, and transglutaminase type II [TGase]) in vivo, while PLZF-RAR alpha expression has either <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect (RAR beta)</SCOPE> or an inhibitory activity (RAR gamma and type II TGase).

<SCOPE><NEG>No</NEG> significant difference was detected in the activation of MAPK kinase-1 that is induced by bufalin in wild-type or Bcl-2-overexpressed U937 cells</SCOPE>; however, the activation of MAPK by bufalin was significantly attenuated in the cells overexpressing Bcl-2.

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that adult and embryonic globin genes were appropriately regulated, <SCOPE><NEG>with the exception of</NEG> beta h1-globin, which continued to be expressed at a very low level</SCOPE>.

When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts, they did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals, based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 (GPI-1) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes</SCOPE>.

The induced complexes were detectable in extracts of cells incubated with anti-class I monoclonal antibody (mAb) for 1.5 h; the induction was maximal at 5 h, persistent at 16 h and <SCOPE><NEG>no longer</NEG> observed at 40 h</SCOPE>.

The mAb <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to induce NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in cells incubated in the presence of 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, an inhibitor of I kappa B-alpha degradation</SCOPE>.

Cyclosporin A interferes with the inducible degradation of NF-kappa B inhibitors, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with the processing of p105/NF-kappa B1 in T cells</SCOPE>.

CsA does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> interfere with the synthesis of Rel proteins</SCOPE>, but prevents the inducible degradation of cytosolic NF-kappa B inhibitors I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta upon T cell activation.

CsA <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> inhibits the processing of the NF-kappa B1 precursor p105 to p50, <NEG>nor</NEG> does it &quot;stabilize&quot; the C-terminal portion of p105, I kappa B gamma, which is degraded during p105 processing to mature p50</SCOPE>.

These results indicate that CsA interferes with a specific event in the signal-induced degradation of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta, but does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the processing of NF-kappa B1/p105 to p50</SCOPE>.

With the aim of identifying genetic targets for these transcription factors, we stably transfected cDNAs encoding EBF or a covalent homodimer of E47, individually or together, into immature hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells, which <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> both factors</SCOPE>.

The correlation is specific as the level of at least three other transcription factors did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> change</SCOPE>.

Interleukin-5 (IL-5), which is produced by CD4(+) T helper 2 (Th2) cells, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by Th1 cells</SCOPE>, plays a key role in the development of eosinophilia in asthma.

During the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells isolated from T cell receptor transgenic mice, GATA-3 gene expression was up-regulated in developing Th2 cells, but was down-regulated in Th1 cells, and antigen- or cAMP-activated Th2 cells (but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> Th1 cells</SCOPE>) expressed the GATA-3 protein.

These compounds strongly increased the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate response, whereas we have <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> observed a contribution of phosphatase inhibitors on a CCK-8-induced luciferase activity</SCOPE>.

Cytokine-stimulated cell surface expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1, CD106) and E-selectin (ELAM-1, CD62E), but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54)</SCOPE>, was time- and dose-dependently inhibited by TCP succinate but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by TCP or TCP acetate</SCOPE>.

Succinate alone had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect</SCOPE>.

TCP succinate (20 microM, 72 h), but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> TCP (200 microM, 72 h)</SCOPE>, reduced U-937 cell adhesion to TNF-alpha-stimulated (10 U/ml, 6 h) HUVEC by 30% (P &lt; 0.025) and to IL-1 beta-stimulated HUVEC by 56% (P &lt; 0.010).

Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays of HUVEC nuclear proteins revealed a decrease in TNF-alpha-stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation after pretreatment of HUVEC with TCP succinate but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with TCP, TCP acetate, or succinate alone</SCOPE>.

NAC inhibited interleukin-1 (IL-1 beta)-induced, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> basal</SCOPE>, adhesion with 50% inhibition at approximately 20 mM.

NAC had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on the half-life of E-selectin or VCAM-1 mRNA</SCOPE>.

Although NAC reduced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation in EC as measured by gel-shift assays using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the consensus NF-kappa B binding sites of the VCAM-1 gene (VCAM-NF-kappa B), the antioxidant had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> appreciable effect when an oligomer corresponding to the consensus NF-kappa B binding site of the E-selectin gene (E-selectin-NF-kappa B) was used</SCOPE>.

The sophisticated control of Rel/NF-kappa B activity is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> surprising</SCOPE> since this transcription factor is involved in a wide array of cellular responses to extracellular cues, associated with growth, development, apoptosis, and pathogen invasion.

Thus, it is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> unexpected that this versatile cellular homeostatic switch would be affected by a variety of viral pathogens, which have evolved mechanisms to utilize various aspects of Rel/NF-kappa B activity to facilitate their replication, cell survival and possibly evasion of immune responses</SCOPE>.

For comparison, we recruited a control group consisting of 32 healthy males and females with similar age distribution and <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> a history of exposure to MTBE or benzene</SCOPE>.

We have identified a novel gene, GR6, located within the leukemia breakpoint region of 3q21, that is normally expressed in early fetal development but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in adult peripheral blood</SCOPE>.

A clinically relevant dose (25 mM) of acute ethanol treatment in vitro increased NF-kappa B binding activity in monocytes with a preferential induction of the inhibitory, p50/p50, NF-kappa B/Rel homodimer, and resulted in <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> induction of the p65/p50 heterodimer</SCOPE>.

Thus, such unique activation of the inhibitory p50/p50 homodimer by acute ethanol treatment may result in inhibition <SCOPE><NEG>rather than</NEG> activation of NF-kappa B-regulated inflammatory cytokine genes</SCOPE>.

Transfection of EL-4 cells with the IL-4 promoter-reporter constructs carrying mutated P-like elements showed that four P-like elements, CLE0, P, P2 and P4, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> P3</SCOPE>, were required for optimal activation of the IL-4 promoter.

Six tandem repeats of the P element linked to the SV40 promoter responded to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, while that of other elements did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

It would thus appear that components of each P-like element-binding complexes are <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> identical</SCOPE> and may coordinately contribute to transcriptional activity.

In addition, BHRF1 protected these cells from monocyte-mediated killing but <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to protect them from killing mediated by lymphokine-activated killer cells</SCOPE>.

Moreover, the mechanism of action of BHRF1 resembled that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as it inhibited TNF- and anti-Fas-induced activation of two enzymes participating in the apoptosis pathway, cytosolic phospholipase A2 and caspase-3/CPP32, but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> interfere with the activation of NF-kappaB-like transcription factors</SCOPE>.

Surprisingly, expression of <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> BHRF1 <NEG>nor</NEG> Bcl-2 in a B-cell line, BJAB, protected the cells from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis</SCOPE> even though they increased the survival of serum-starved cells.

We have therefore investigated the transcriptional activity of A-MYB and its regulation in several human lymphoid cell lines using co-transfection assays and show that A-MYB is transcriptionally active in all the B cell lines studied, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in T cells</SCOPE>.

The activity of A-MYB in B and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> T cells</SCOPE> was observed when either an artificial construct or the c-MYC promoter was used as a reporter.

Finally, a 110-kDa protein has been identified in the nuclei of all the B, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> T</SCOPE>, cell lines that specifically binds to this A-MYB N-terminal domain.

The NF kappa B2 effect was dependent on the presence of the STAT6 binding site, demonstrating that the NF kappa B2 motif is necessary but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> sufficient for mediating cytokine up-regulation</SCOPE>.

In addition, the combination of a NF kappa B/rel binding site and the STAT6 response element conferred IL-4 inducibility to a heterologous minimal promoter, while the individual sites had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect</SCOPE>.

Restriction analysis revealed that neutrophils express the GH-N gene but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the GH-V gene</SCOPE>.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the IL-7 effect involve the upregulation of the DNA binding activity of NFAT (60%) and AP-1 (120%), <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> affecting the activities of NFkappaB and CD28RC</SCOPE>, which was confirmed by transfection assays.

We also show that the IL-7-induced enhancement of the AP-1-DNA binding activity is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> cyclosporin A-sensitive</SCOPE>.

By contrast, <SCOPE>the monocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor was largely <NEG>absent</NEG> at this stage and in the CD34+Thy-1-CD45RA- subsets</SCOPE>.

In conclusion, the presence of myeloid-associated growth factor receptor transcripts in CD34+ CB subsets does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> discriminate the various stages of differentiation, <SCOPE><NEG>with the exception of</NEG> the M-CSF receptor</SCOPE></SCOPE>.

This was also accompanied by a decrease in both PKC activity and nuclear transcription factor-kappaB activation, also <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> loss of cell viability</SCOPE>.

In the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of TCR-mediated activation</SCOPE>, Vpr induces apoptosis whereas in its presence, Vpr interrupts the expected induction of apoptosis.

Analysis of Tax mutants showed that <SCOPE>two mutants, IEXC29S and IEXL320G, were <NEG>unable</NEG> to significantly transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter</SCOPE>.

Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that <SCOPE>Tax mutant IEXC29S is <NEG>unable</NEG> to interact with NGFI-A/Egr-1</SCOPE>, whereas Tax mutant IEXL320G is able to interact with NGFI-A/Egr-1.

Although subtle gene movements within those defined topographical regions cannot be excluded by this study, the results indicate that <SCOPE>tissue specificity of gene expression is <NEG>not</NEG> accompanied by drastic changes in gene nuclear topography</SCOPE>, rather suggesting that gene organization within the nucleus may be primarily dependent on structural constraints imposed on the respective chromosomes.

This adhesion molecule was also expressed by T cells obtained from one patient with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> by activated T cells isolated from one normal blood donor</SCOPE>.

After stimulation, neutrophils separated from a healthy human volunteer were added with or <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> anti-CD18 antibody</SCOPE>.

This inhibition is selective, as <SCOPE>the activity of four other transcription factors, Oct-1, TBP, Sp1 and STAT 5 was <NEG>not</NEG> affected</SCOPE>.

We show that inhibition is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> due to a direct modification of the active NF-kappaB heterodimer</SCOPE>.

Double-stimulation was used to demonstrate that, in a T lymphocytic cell line (CEM), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) rapidly induced NF-kappa B through a signaling pathway which did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> involve reactive oxygen species (ROS)</SCOPE> and was different from the activation triggered by either H2O2 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).

Since these latter compounds were known to activate NF-kappa B translocation in a redox-sensitive way, we have demonstrated that NF-kappa B activation by PMA was resistant to antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and sensitive to kinase inhibitors staurosporine and H7 while activation by H2O2 or TNF-alpha were <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

Suppression of MHC class II expression by human class II trans-activator constructs <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> the N-terminal domain</SCOPE>.

Since the DSE and TRE sites <SCOPE><NEG>cannot</NEG> bind CREB/ATF homodimers</SCOPE>, we propose a mechanism in which the HIV-1 DSE bind heterodimers composed of both AP-1 and CREB/ATF proteins.

Signals from TES1 are sufficient to drive initial proliferation of infected resting B lymphocytes, but most lymphoblastoid cells infected with a virus that does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> express the 155 residues beyond TES1</SCOPE> <SCOPE><NEG>fail</NEG> to grow as long-term cell lines</SCOPE>.

TRADD was the only protein that interacted with wild-type TES2 and <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with isoleucine-mutated TES2</SCOPE>.

TRADD associated with wild-type LMP1 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with isoleucine-mutated LMP1 in mammalian cells</SCOPE>, and TRADD constitutively associated with LMP1 in EBV-transformed cells.

<SCOPE>A threonine residue at position 234, previously shown to be important for CD40 association with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TRAF3, and TRAF5, was <NEG>not</NEG> required for NF-kappa B activation</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>CD40- or pervanadate-mediated I kappa B tyrosine phosphorylation was <NEG>not</NEG> detected</SCOPE>.

In contrast, expression of B cell-expressed genes that are <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> dependent on cell-specific controls</SCOPE> is unaffected.

We show that the molecular mechanism(s) underlying Ig gene extinction can be explained, at least in part, by a <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of transcription factors that are essential for Ig gene transcription</SCOPE>.

These transcription factors are either <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> produced due to block of transcription of their respective genes (Oct-2, OBF-1, PU.1)</SCOPE>, or are rendered inactive posttranslationally (NF-kappa B, E47).

These bHLH antagonists are induced during a mitogenic signalling response, and they function by sequestering their bHLH targets in inactive heterodimers that <SCOPE>are <NEG>unable</NEG> to bind to specific gene regulatory (E box) sequences</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, compared with wild-type Id3, <SCOPE>an Id3 Asp5 mutant (mimicking phosphorylation) is <NEG>unable</NEG> to promote cell cycle S phase entry in transfected fibroblasts</SCOPE>, whereas an Id3 Ala5 mutant (ablating phosphorylation) displays an activity significantly greater than that of wild-type Id3 protein.

These data also demonstrate that the ability of Id3 to promote cell cycle S phase entry is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> simply a function of its ability to modulate bHLH heterodimer-dependent gene expression</SCOPE> and establish a biologically important mechanism through which Cdk2 and Id-bHLH functions are integrated in the coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation.

Human endothelial cells were exposed to hypoxia in the presence or <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of added lipopolysaccharide (LPS)</SCOPE> and examined for expression of functional ICAM-1.

Although hypoxia alone did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce ICAM-1</SCOPE>, the combination of LPS and hypoxia enhanced (3 ± 0.4-fold over normoxia) ICAM-1 expression.

NB4 cells pulse-exposed (30 minutes) to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), washed, and cultured (3 days) with either dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) had a prominent increase in levels of C/EBP epsilon mRNA and an increase in granulocytic differentiation, but exposure to either DMSO or HMBA alone had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on base levels of C/EBP epsilon</SCOPE> and did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce differentiation</SCOPE>.

Furthermore, this C/EBP epsilon mRNA accumulation did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> require synthesis of new protein factors</SCOPE> because 9-cis RA induced C/EBP epsilon mRNA accumulation in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of new protein synthesis</SCOPE>.

This induction of C/EBP epsilon mRNA expression is transcriptionally mediated and occurs in the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of synthesis of additional protein factors</SCOPE>.

The expression of I kappa B-alpha gene, which is responsive to activation by NF-kappa B, was up-regulated in PBMC and monocytes from patients, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in mononuclear cells from healthy subjects or those with nontuberculous lung diseases</SCOPE>.

By contrast, <SCOPE>the expression of other adherence-associated early genes, such as IL-8 and IL-1 beta, was <NEG>not</NEG> up-regulated in PBMC of tuberculous patients</SCOPE>.

Results indicated that (i) constitutive c-fos transcript levels are significantly higher in patients subsequently responding to IFN-alpha therapy (p &lt; 0.01) and positively correlated with the proportion of lymphocytes (r = 0.6895, p &lt; 0.01) and negatively with the proportion of immature cells (r = -0.568, p &lt; 0.01) contained in the pbmc preparations tested, (ii) constitutive mRNA levels of the hybrid bcr/abl, c-myc and p53 are positively correlated with each other, but <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to relate to disease parameters</SCOPE>, and (iii) acute and chronic in vivo exposure to IFN-alpha is accompanied by upregulation of c-fos and downregulation of c-myc mRNA levels in responder patients.

A murine T cell line, EL4, was stimulated with IL-1 with and <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> pretreatment with different compounds known to influence the cellular redox status</SCOPE>.

N-Acetylcysteine, alpha,alpha&apos;-dipyridyl, aminotriazole or nitrofurantoin did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> show any effect</SCOPE>.

Using protein-DNA interaction assays we show that the H4 promoter contains two ATF/CREB recognition motifs which interact with CREB, ATF1, and ATF2 but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> with ATF4/CREB2</SCOPE>.

Surprisingly, G28-5 sFv was a potent CD40 agonist that rapidly crosslinked CD40 on the cell surface but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> crosslink CD40-Ig in solution</SCOPE>.

However, <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> transcription deficiency has been demonstrated in either XP-B or XP-D</SCOPE>.

Thus, we conclude that the XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> have impaired RNA transcription activity</SCOPE>.

However, IL2 does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> reverse CsA inhibition</SCOPE>, suggesting that at least one other NFAT-sensitive gene may be involved.

Our results suggest that G0S2 expression is required to commit cells to enter the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and that, while <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> excluding other possible targets</SCOPE>, early inhibition of G0S2 expression by CsA may be important in achieving immunosuppression.

In contrast, <SCOPE>the binding activities of NF1 and Sp1 were <NEG>not</NEG> affected by ER</SCOPE>.

We have hypothesized that such defects in fetal/neonatal T-cell activation may be due to <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of expression of the transcriptional regulatory elements required for T-cell activation</SCOPE>.

Thus, <SCOPE>qualitative differences in the capacity to regulate these factors could <NEG>not</NEG> be shown in fetal blood cells</SCOPE>.

Moreover, supplementing the cultures with high doses of IL-2 reverted anti-TNF-alpha inhibition of cell proliferation but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect the inhibition of HIV p24 antigen release or NF-kappa B activation in the same cultures</SCOPE>.

Moreover, anti-TNF-alpha inhibited HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription of a reporter gene in primary T cells in response to activation, either in the presence or the <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of HIV-1 Tat</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>The same gene segment was <NEG>not</NEG> transcribed in IL-5-nonproducing T cell clones</SCOPE>, suggesting that human T cell IL-5 synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level.

There is <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> significant difference in the turnover of pre- and post-inductive I kappa B alpha</SCOPE>.

The <SCOPE><NEG>absence</NEG> of slow migrating forms of I kappa B beta following stimulation</SCOPE> suggests that the phosphorylation does not necessarily constitute the signal-induced event which targets the molecule for proteolysis.

In addition, both RelA and c-Rel, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> NF-kappa B1</SCOPE>, were shown to transactivate an ICAM-1 kappa B-reporter construct.

We now show that a mutant motif that exchanges the terminal 3&apos; C for a G <SCOPE><NEG>fails</NEG> to bind the p50 homodimer that is upregulated in LPS toler ant human Mono Mac 6 cells</SCOPE>.

Conversely, the murine kappa light chain enhancer motif (GGGGACTTTCCG) does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> efficiently bind the nuclear p50p50 from tolerant murine P388 macrophages</SCOPE>.

Activation of NF-kappa B seems to play an important role in the regulation of many proinflammatory cytokine genes, but cannot be the only mechanism, since several cytokine genes <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> respective binding sites in their promoter regions</SCOPE>.

We identified a cell-type-specific differential response: CREB, CTF, OTF-1, OFT-2, and NF-kappa B genes were strongly induced 1 to 4 hours after influenza A virus infection in the monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6, while in freshly prepared human monocytes <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> significant changes were detected</SCOPE>.

Moreover, transfection of Daudi cells with the polymerized NF-kappaB binding sequence ligated to a thymidine kinase/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid greatly induced CAT activity, but transfection with the polymerized mutated NF-kappaB binding sequence did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG></SCOPE>.

Interestingly, the DEX-mediated IkappaBalpha induction was completely inhibited by IL-2, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> IL-4</SCOPE>, in Th1 cells, while the reverse profile was seen in Th2 cells.

Recently, we showed that elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated transcription in human monocytes and endothelial cells <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> preventing nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB complexes</SCOPE>.

Lysates from CD19 cross-linked 1E8 cells induced robust phosphorylation of an Elk-1 fusion protein in vitro, whereas <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> phosphorylation of Elk-1 fusion protein occurred using lysates from CD19 cross-linked BLIN-1 cells</SCOPE>.

An electrophoretic mobility shift assay employing AP-1 and NF-kappaB consensus oligonucleotides was used to demonstrate that AP-1 -binding activity increased, while <SCOPE>constitutive NF-kappaB-binding activity was <NEG>not</NEG> enhanced</SCOPE>, following 2 h of CD19 cross-linking in 1E8 cells.

In contrast, CD19 cross-linking in BLIN-1 cells resulted in the induction of NF-kappaB, but had <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> apparent effect on AP-1-binding activity</SCOPE>.

Northern blot analysis <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to detect IL-2 mRNA</SCOPE>, suggesting that IL-2 may act in a paracrine manner in vivo.

IL-2 binding analysis demonstrated that IL-2 markedly increased the number of low affinity IL-2Rs on the leukemia cells, <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> an effect on the number of high-affinity IL-2Rs</SCOPE>.

Conversely, a dominant negative version of TRAF6 <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to block hToll-induced activation of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases</SCOPE>, thus suggesting an early divergence of the two pathways.

Surprisingly, however, removal of PC4 from the unfractionated nuclear extract has <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> detrimental effect on OCA-B/Oct-1-dependent transcription</SCOPE>.

M. tuberculosis ManLAM resulted in clear induction of the luciferase gene placed under the control of the wild-type, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the kappaB-mutated</SCOPE>, HIV-1 LTR region.

The only exception was hydrogen peroxide at 20 microM, which did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce catalase activity</SCOPE>.

We conclude that: (i) suppression of specific transcription factor functions can potentially serve as a marker of exposure to oxidative stress and its effects on human lymphocytes; (ii) lipid peroxidation is only detectable in human lymphocytes upon exposure to weak oxidative stress which does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce catalase activity</SCOPE>; (iii) therefore, transcription factor DNA-binding activities are more sensitive to oxidative stress than lipid peroxidation.

A nondegradable mutant of I kappa B blocked both FasL expression and apoptosis induced by DNA damage but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> Fas ligation</SCOPE>.

TPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the TPO receptor but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor</SCOPE>.

There was <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> competition between TPO and EPO for binding to EPO receptor</SCOPE>.

Dithiocarbamates (DTC), a diverse group of industrial and therapeutic chemicals, have been reported to inhibit, enhance or have <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on the immune system</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>This inhibition is <NEG>not</NEG> accompanied by a loss in viability</SCOPE>, and DMDTC-treated T cells retain other active signaling pathways throughout the exposure duration.

The inhibition of NF-kappaB is apparently permanent as DMDTC-treated T cells did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> regain normal TNF-alpha activation, even after 72 h in culture</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE>DMDTC does <NEG>not</NEG> appear to alter NF-kappaB directly</SCOPE> as pre-incubation of nuclear extracts with DMDTC does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> diminish binding activity of this protein</SCOPE>.

We demonstrate in this report that overexpression of an activated form of Rho enhances AP-1 activity in Jurkat T cells in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), but activated Rho (V14Rho) has little or <SCOPE><NEG>no</NEG> effect on NFAT, Oct-1, and NF-kappaB enhancer element activities under similar conditions</SCOPE>.

The effect of Rho on AP-1 is independent of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, as a dominant-negative MEK and a MEK inhibitor (PD98059) did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> affect Rho-induced AP-1 activity</SCOPE>.

In contrast, a mutant of Tax termed M22, which does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce NF-kappaB</SCOPE>, <SCOPE><NEG>fails</NEG> to activate either IKKalpha or IKKbeta</SCOPE>.

However, plasma membrane-proximal elements in these proinflammatory cytokine pathways are apparently <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> involved</SCOPE> since dominant negative mutants of the TRAF2 and TRAF6 adaptors, which effectively block signaling through the cytoplasmic tails of the TNF-alpha and IL-1 receptors, respectively, do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> inhibit Tax induction of NF-kappaB</SCOPE>.

A CD28-associated signaling pathway leading to cytokine gene transcription and T cell proliferation <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> TCR engagement</SCOPE>.

Stimulation of resting human T cells with the CD28-specific mAb BW 828 induces proliferation and cytokine synthesis <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> further requirement for TCR coengagement</SCOPE>.

This observation prompted us to postulate that signal 2 (costimulatory signal) alone <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> signal 1 (TCR signal)</SCOPE> can activate T cells.

Stimulation of T cells with BW 828 induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+, but did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> lead to detectable activation of the protein kinases p56(lck) and c-Raf-1</SCOPE>.

On the other hand, stimulation of T cells with mAb 9.3 increased the level of intracellular Ca2+ and triggered the activation of p56(lck) and c-Raf-1, but <SCOPE>was <NEG>unable</NEG> to induce the binding of transcription factors to the IL-2 promoter</SCOPE>.

We demonstrate that IL-12 induces STAT4 only in freshly isolated primary NK cells, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in primary T cells</SCOPE>, consistent with the <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> of the IL-12 receptor in resting T cells</SCOPE>.

Moreover, IL-4 costimulation with IL-2 or IL-12 does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> alter their own preferential GAS-like DNA binding patterns when C epsilon-, Fc gamma RI-, and SIE GAS motif containing oligonucleotide probes are compared</SCOPE>, suggesting that induction of GAS-like DNA-protein binding complexes by IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12 is highly selective and represents one important factor in determining specific gene activation.

Low concentrations of RA inhibiting IgE synthesis (10(-10) mol/L) affected <SCOPE><NEG>neither</NEG> B-cell proliferation <NEG>nor</NEG> the production of IgA, IgG, and IgM</SCOPE>.

Elucidation of the mechanism involved in this inhibition of IgE production shows that epsilon germline transcription is decreased by RA, whereas <SCOPE>production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was <NEG>not</NEG> enhanced in the presence of RA</SCOPE>.

Taken together, our results suggest that <SCOPE>the age-related hyporesponsiveness <NEG>cannot</NEG> be attributed to a skewing of the T cell population towards a memory phenotype in the elderly</SCOPE>.

Indeed, when Tax is coexpressed with the E2F-1 transcription factor in CEM T-cells, which <SCOPE><NEG>lack</NEG> expression of p16(INK4A)</SCOPE>, it strongly potentiates the E2F-dependent activation of a reporter construct driven by a promoter containing E2F binding sites.

Using Tax mutants that <SCOPE><NEG>fail</NEG> to activate either ATF- or NF-kappaB-dependent promoters and different 5&apos; truncation mutants of the E2F-1 promoter</SCOPE>, we show that the Tax-dependent transcriptional control of the E2F1 gene involves, at least in part, the ATF binding site located in the E2F-1 promoter.

<SCOPE>Fragmentation was <NEG>not</NEG> observed in ICR27TK.3 cells containing mutant glucocorticoid receptors (L753F) that are activation-deficient but retain the ability to repress AP-1 activity</SCOPE>.

<SCOPE><NEG>Nor</NEG> was fragmentation observed after treatment with RU38486</SCOPE>, indicating that <SCOPE>repression of AP-1 activity is <NEG>not</NEG> involved</SCOPE>.

Dexamethasone treatment completely blocked 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induction of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity and elicited an increase in the amount of immunoreactive IkappaB alpha in sensitive 6TG1.1 cells but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> in resistant ICR27TK.3 cells</SCOPE>.

Impairments in the translocation of Rel-B and c-Rel further suggest that <SCOPE>the NFKB family members Rel-A, Rel-B and c-Rel are <NEG>not</NEG> required for the transcription of IL-2 in the peripheral T lymphocytes of patients with breast cancer</SCOPE>.

Induction of Mn SOD in human monocytes <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> inflammatory cytokine production by a mutant endotoxin</SCOPE>.

Endotoxin selectively induces monocyte Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD) <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> affecting levels of Cu,Zn SOD, catalase, or glutathione peroxidase</SCOPE>.

In this study we demonstrated that a mutant Escherichia coli endotoxin <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> myristoyl fatty acid at the 3&apos; R-3-hydroxymyristate position of the lipid A moiety</SCOPE> retained its full capacity to coagulate Limulus amoebocyte lysate compared with the wild-type E. coli endotoxin and markedly stimulated the activation of human monocyte nuclear factor-kappaB and the induction of Mn SOD mRNA and enzyme activity.

However, in contrast to the wild-type endotoxin, it <SCOPE><NEG>failed</NEG> to induce significant production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha by monocytes</SCOPE> and did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> induce the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of mitogen-activated protein kinase</SCOPE>.

These results suggest that 1) lipid A myristoyl fatty acid, although it is important for the induction of inflammatory cytokine production by human monocytes, is <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> necessary for the induction of Mn SOD</SCOPE>, 2) endotoxin-mediated induction of Mn SOD and inflammatory cytokines are regulated, at least in part, through different signal transduction pathways, and 3) <SCOPE><NEG>failure</NEG> of the mutant endotoxin to induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha production</SCOPE> is, at least in part, due to its inability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase.

Additionally, to determine the impact of RXR for erythroid cell development, dominant interfering mutant RXRs, <SCOPE><NEG>lacking</NEG> the transcriptional activator functions AF-1 and AF-2, or AF-2 only, or the entire DNA-binding domain</SCOPE>, were introduced into erythroid progenitor cells via recombinant retrovirus vectors and analyzed for RXR-specific effects.

Apoptosis was prevented when CD4 truncated at residue 402 was expressed; however, cells expressing mutated receptors that do <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> associate with p56(lck) (mutated at the dicysteine motif and truncated at residue 418)</SCOPE> but which conserved proximal domains of the cytoplasmic tail underwent apoptosis like wild- type CD4.

The differences between wild-type and mutated receptors in the induction of apoptosis were <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> related to levels of p56(lck) or NF- kappaB activation</SCOPE>.

Incubation of HIV-infected cells with monoclonal antibody (MAb) 13B8-2, which binds to CD4 in a region critical for dimerization of the receptor, prevented apoptosis <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> inhibiting HIV replication</SCOPE>.

Moreover, the apoptotic process was <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> related to Fas-Fas ligand interaction</SCOPE>; however, an antagonistic anti-Fas MAb (ZB-4) enhanced apoptosis in HIV-infected cells <SCOPE><NEG>without</NEG> inducing apoptosis in uninfected cells</SCOPE>.

These observations demonstrate that CD4 signaling mediates HIV-induced apoptosis by a mechanism independent of Fas-Fas ligand interaction, does <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> require p56(lck) signaling</SCOPE>, and may involve a critical region for CD4 dimerization.

In neonatal T cells NF-kappa B activation and ROI formation after anti-CD3 stimulation were low compared with adult T cells and, although addition of anti-CD28 mAb increased induction of NF-kappa B and ROI formation, <SCOPE>levels similar to those of adults were <NEG>not</NEG> achieved</SCOPE>.

Our results suggest that reduced IL-2 production by neonatal T cells is specific for anti-CD3 and anti-CD3+ anti-CD28-mediated stimulation and that these activators <SCOPE><NEG>cannot</NEG> effectively activate the ROI-NF-kappa B signalling pathway in neonatal T cells</SCOPE>.

Liposomal transfection of a double-stranded kappaB phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, but <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> of the mutated form</SCOPE>, inhibited MCP-1 secretion and surface expression of ICAM-1 on activated endothelium (P&lt;0.05).

Because point mutagenesis <SCOPE><NEG>cannot</NEG> distinguish between family members</SCOPE>, it is not known which protein activates 5&apos;HS3.

It was concluded that even when <SCOPE>LMP1 is <NEG>unable</NEG> to activate NF-kappaB</SCOPE>, it is still capable of inducing certain characteristics of activated B cells, strongly suggesting that LMP1 can also activate cells independently of NF-kappaB.

However, the cells obtained from IL-2-treated patients did <SCOPE><NEG>not</NEG> have low-level constitutive expression of STAT binding factors</SCOPE> as did LAK cells.
